Welcome to Xenify! Our groundbreaking protocol synergistically blends DBXen’s innovative tokenomics and ChainZap’s powerful functionality into one powerful package, setting the stage for a seismic shift in the DeFi landscape. With a maximum total supply of only 21,500,000 XNF tokens, Xenify empowers users to earn XNF while simultaneously functioning as a first-layer burner for the XEN token. Our overarching mission? To revolutionise the DeFi space with a seamless, ultra-efficient cross-chain swapping experience that lavishes users with Native Chain Rewards and a token with a finite supply.

At the core of Xenify's bold vision is ChainZap, a cutting-edge liquidity aggregation protocol that streamlines cross-chain token swaps. Whether you want to swap tokens on Ethereum, BNB Chain, Polygon, Arbitrum, or any of the 36 supported chains, Xenify has you covered. With access to 19 different aggregators, Xenify guarantees unparalleled liquidity and optimal rates for your swaps. By leveraging cutting-edge APIs, Xenify bridges seamless communication with a wide array of DEX aggregators, dramatically enhancing the swapping experience and streamlining the quest for optimal swap routes across the vast tapestry of chains.

With Xenify's built-in swap and burn fee mechanisms, a reciprocal environment that benefits all participants is established. Wherein XNF stakers are generously rewarded with an impressive 100% of swap fees and burn fees as Native Chain Rewards across all supported chains. That's right, stakers earn from every swap and burn!

What's more, Xenify's innovative design has enabled the seamless integration of the YSL.IO protocol, incorporating its state-of-the-art AlphaVaults and MetaVaults into the daily reward distribution process. Thanks to this integration, an incredible 100% of yields obtained from the rehypothecation of vault assets are directed straight to Xenify, fuelling development and rewarding XNF stakers. In return, YSL.IO acquires an XNF position and channels 100% of the Native Chain Rewards it earns to vault participants. This win-win strategy guarantees a continuous flow of Native Chain Rewards for XNF stakers and ensures Xenify's expansion, even without swaps or burns. As a result, long-term user engagement is fostered for both Xenify and YSL.IO, and rewards are boosted for those who are truly dedicated to each protocol.

At the heart of Xenify's ethos is a steadfast commitment to fairness and transparency, embodied by our exemplary token distribution model. There will be no team, founder, or investor allocation. In fact, the only way to mint XNF tokens is through active participation in the ecosystem - by either burning or swapping tokens. This approach certifies a genuinely equitable distribution of XNF tokens, rewarding users for their contributions and fostering a truly community-driven protocol.

As we bring together the cutting-edge liquidity aggregation of ChainZap and our own distinctive tokenomics, Xenify is poised to redefine the landscape of cross-chain swapping, all while nurturing a thriving ecosystem that places utmost importance on user satisfaction and sustainable growth. Join us as we take a leap into the future, and experience the world of Xenify - a realm where innovation meets reward, where community powers expansion, and where the foundation for DeFi's bright tomorrow is being laid. Welcome to the revolution!

## ♦️ Staking

- Xenify integrates a dynamic staking rewards mechanism that offers significant benefits to XNF stakers. By staking XNF tokens, users become eligible to receive a resounding 100% of burn fees and swap fees generated on supported chains as Native Chain Rewards. But that’s not all! Owing to Xenify's seamless integration with the YSL.IO protocol, an additional layer of rewards is offered to XNF stakers. Within this framework, a full 100% of the yield generated from the rehypothecation of YSL.IO AlphaVault and MetaVault assets are redirected to Xenify and shared amongst XNF stakers. This equitable incentive model ensures that active participants in the ecosystem are amply rewarded, helping us foster a vibrant and engaged community.

![Grey V4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60996729/235287926-6b18081e-ca41-48c7-8dfc-29cc32c598f1.png)

## ♦️ Token Burning

- If users want to acquire XNF tokens, they can do so by burning vXEN and vUSDy tokens. Think of vXEN and vUSDy as virtual counterparts of XEN and USDy, respectively. These tokens have been designed exclusively for the purpose of converting into XNF. 

- To get your hands on vXEN, you'll need XEN tokens or a version of the XEN token supported by Xenify. For example, if you have bXEN (the XEN token residing on the BNB Chain), you can easily convert it into vXEN. And once you have vXEN, you can burn it to participate in Xenify’s daily distribution of XNF tokens. Both the bXEN and vXEN you provide are burned by the protocol, removing them from circulation. It's as straightforward as that. Keep in mind that the conversion rate will be fixed but may vary based on the version of the XEN token you're exchanging.

- Similarly, if you're interested in obtaining vUSDy, you'll need to possess YSL.IO native tokens like bYSL, xYSL, or USDy. For example, if you have bYSL, you can easily convert it into vUSDy. And once you have vUSDy, you can burn it to participate in Xenify’s daily distribution of XNF tokens. Both the bYSL and vUSDy you provide are burned by the protocol, removing them from circulation. Just like with vXEN, the conversion rate for vUSDy is fixed, but it depends on the specific YSL.IO native token you're exchanging.

- Now, you may be wondering why we've integrated the burning of XEN and USDy tokens. Well, it's not just a smart move to reduce the circulating supply of both these tokens; it's also a powerful way to connect our communities. We want to strengthen both the XEN and YSL.IO ecosystems while strategically unifying our communities under a shared vision.

## ♦️ Cross-Chain Swapping

- Xenify's integration with ChainZap enables users to execute seamless cross-chain swaps, making it easier than ever to exchange tokens across different chains. Our streamlined process offers a new level of simplicity in cross-chain token swaps and provides access to the most competitive rates available, while delivering an efficient and user-friendly DeFi experience like never before.

## ♦️ Fair Equity Distribution

- Xenify is dedicated to promoting fairness and transparency in the distribution of equity among its users. Our unique tokenomics and staking model are designed to reward active participants and long-term holders, creating a strong incentive for users to contribute to the growth of our ecosystem. As our community continues to grow, the equitable distribution of rewards and XNF tokens ensures that everyone benefits, promoting a vibrant and engaged community.

# ◽️ XEN Overview 
![Line Divider - Filled](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60996729/233879462-b465c484-4c2f-4cd2-a126-19529e333d64.png)

<br>

XEN is a project that was launched on the principles of self-custody, trustless consensus, and decentralisation. It is a joint effort of several blockchain enthusiasts who aim to create a fairer, more transparent mining ecosystem.

One of the main goals of XEN is to democratise mining by providing a decentralised platform that allows anyone to participate in the mining process. This is achieved by utilising a Proof-of-Work (PoW) consensus algorithm that is resistant to ASIC mining, thus ensuring that the network remains accessible to individual miners.

In addition to its mining capabilities, XEN also features a native cryptocurrency, the XEN token, which is used to incentivise miners and maintain the security of the network. XEN tokens are also used to pay for transaction fees and other network services.

XEN operates on a Proof of Participation (PoP) system, which allows participants to mint their coins. The XEN smart contract employs a fair distribution system based on reward time locks and the total number of participants. XEN's value is linked to its difficulty to be minted, similar to Bitcoin. As more participants join and mint XEN, the total amount of generated XEN drops, making it more scarce and valuable.

One of the key features of XEN is its simplicity, as it is based on the ERC20 token standard with minimal code, no pre-minting, hidden doors, admin keys, or origin wallets. Furthermore, XEN has a supply of zero and can only be minted by the participating community. This makes it inflationary at the beginning and disinflationary as adoption increases. XEN is immutable and has no backing by investors or intrinsic value.

To mint XEN, participants can connect their Ethereum-compatible wallets to the XEN smart contract and specify the number of days they are willing to wait to receive XEN. The smart contract generates a XEN rank (cRANK) based on how many people interacted with the contract before the participant. Participants can also stake XEN for 1 to 1,000 days, with APY rewards starting at 20% on XEN Genesis and decreasing by 1 percentage point every 90 days until it reaches 2%, where it will remain indefinitely.

Overall, XEN represents an innovative approach to mining that emphasises decentralisation, accessibility, and sustainability. XEN's combination of features, simplicity and fairness make it a unique and promising project in the crypto space.

## ♦️ Unifying the Chains (vXEN)

Introducing vXEN, a groundbreaking solution by Xenify that enables seamless burning of XEN across all chains, unifying the XEN ecosystem and supporting its deflationary nature. This innovative approach has been made possible through the integration of Alexar, a decentralised protocol that breaks down barriers between cross-chain communication with its comprehensive protocol suite.

Thanks to vXEN, users are not required to hold native XEN tokens based on the Ethereum network to participate in Xenify's burn process and acquire XNF. Instead, Xenify empowers users from the wider XEN ecosystem to acquire XNF by effortlessly burning their native XEN tokens from various EVM-compatible networks directly from their wallets.

This remarkable solution stems from Xenify's shared commitment to the interoperability of the XEN ecosystem and the vision of making Xenify accessible to XEN holders across multiple chains. As a result, vXEN enables Xenify to seamlessly interact with any chain supported by the XEN ecosystem, establishing itself as a strategic layer 2 burner of XEN.

Think of vXEN as the virtual counterpart of XEN tokens, designed exclusively to facilitate the conversion of native XEN token variants into XNF tokens. It's worth noting that acquiring vXEN requires XEN tokens or a XEN token variant supported by Xenify, such as bXEN on the BNB Chain.

vXEN can be thought of as the virtual counterpart of XEN tokens, designed solely to facilitate the conversion of native XEN token variants into XNF tokens. It's important to note that acquiring vXEN requires XEN tokens or a XEN token variant supported by Xenify, such as bXEN on the BNB Chain.

Once you possess vXEN, you can burn it to participate in Xenify's daily distribution of XNF tokens. With each XEN variant having a fixed conversion rate, it eliminates the guesswork from determining how much XEN you're required to burn as a batch. In other words, users can always be confident in the amount of vXEN they'll obtain when burning their native XEN tokens. Please bear in mind that although the conversion rate for vXEN remains fixed, it will vary depending on the specific version of the XEN token you choose to exchange, as outlined in the table below:

<br>

| Network     | Native Token     | Conversion Rate       |
|-------------|------------------|-----------------------|
| Ethereum    | XEN              | 1 vXEN = 1 XEN        |
| Avalanche   | aXEN             | 1 vXEN = 67 aXEN      |
| BNB Chain   | bXEN             | 1 vXEN = 108 bXEN     |
| Polygon     | mXEN             | 1 vXEN = 144 mXEN     |
| MoonBeam    | mbXEN            | 1 vXEN = 372 mbXEN    |
| Fantom      | fmXEN            | 1 vXEN = 529 fmXEN    |
| OKX         | okXEN            | 1 vXEN = 1380 okXEN   |
| Evmos       | coXEN            | 1 vXEN = 3349 coXEN   |

# ◽️ USDy Overview 
![Line Divider - Filled](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60996729/233879462-b465c484-4c2f-4cd2-a126-19529e333d64.png)

USDy is a reward token that incentivizes participation in the YSL.IO ecosystem with stability and sustainability at its core. Developed with cutting-edge tokenomincs, the YSL.IO protocol boasts a host of innovative features that make USDy a standout reward token in the DeFi landscape.

One of the key highlights of USDy is its Price Stability Model (PSM), which ensures a continuous increase in liquidity, even in the face of sell pressure. The protocol achieves this through a combination of autonomous Treasury-Owned Liquidity creation and an ingenious Buyback and Burn feature (UBB), which actively works to stabilise the price of USDy.

Here's how it works: the UBB is activated every 4-epochs if the USDy pool price falls below $0.95. During this time, a portion of the tax from every trade of YSL, xYSL, bYSL, and USDy will be used to purchase and/or burn USDy. Additionally, 15% of every HydraVault deposit will also be used to purchase and burn USDy.

What's more, the protocol generates Treasury-Owned Liquidity for USDy at every point of user interaction, ensuring that as more users join the YSL.IO ecosystem, USDy's liquidity grows autonomously. And to further reduce the supply of USDy and increase its price, the Incentive Buyback mechanism (UIB) kicks in every time someone purchases the YSL token using ChainZap. This mechanism incorporates a 25% incentive to purchase YSL while actively reducing the supply of USDy.

Here's how it works: all of the USDC sent will be used to purchase and burn USDy equivalent to 175%, and as a bonus, users receive a complimentary 25% USDy for each purchase. The result is a reduction in USDy supply and an increase in its price, benefiting USDy holders.

In conclusion, USDy has been carefully crafted by YSL.IO with a focus on price stability, and liquidity growth. With innovative features like UBB and UIB, USDy liquidity will continue to grow autonomously while its price remains stable, creating a sustainable, less volatile, and more robust ecosystem.

## ♦️ Unifying the YSL.IO Ecosystem (vUSDy)

Introducing vUSDy, another groundbreaking solution by Xenify that enables seamless burning of YSL.IO native tokens, thereby unifying the YSL.IO ecosystem and supporting the protocol's cutting-edge Price Stability Model for its native tokens. 

This innovative approach to token burning has been made possible through the integration of Alexar, a decentralised protocol that breaks down barriers between cross-chain communication with its comprehensive protocol suite.

Similar to vXEN, users are not obligated to possess the native XEN token on the Ethereum network in order to participate in Xenify's burn process and acquire XNF. Instead, Xenify empowers users within the YSL.IO ecosystem to effortlessly burn their YSL.IO native tokens directly from their wallets and acquire XNF.

This solution truly reflects Xenify's dedication to interoperability, by expanding the protocol's scope and unlocking endless possibilities through the strategic unification of the XEN and YSL.IO ecosystems, fostering a shared vision that brings both communities together.

vUSDy can be regarded as the virtual counterpart of YSL.IO's reward token, known as USDy. The sole purpose of vUSDy is to facilitate the conversion of YSL.IO native token variants into XNF tokens. It's important to note that acquiring vUSDy requires USDy tokens or a YSL.IO token variant supported by Xenify, such as bYSL or xYSL.

Once you possess vUSDy, you can burn it to participate in Xenify's daily distribution of XNF tokens. With each YSL.IO token variant having a fixed conversion rate, it eliminates the guesswork from determining how much XEN you're required to burn as a batch. In other words, users can always have confidence in the amount of vUSDy they will obtain when burning their YSL.IO native tokens. Please bear in mind that although the conversion rate for vUSDy remains fixed, it will vary depending on the specific YSL.IO native token you choose to exchange, as outlined in the table below:

<br>

| Native Token        | Conversion Rate      |
|---------------------|----------------------|
| USDy                | 1 USDy = 1 vUSDy     |
| bYSL                | 1 bYSL = 5 vUSDy     |
| xYSL                | 1 xYSL = 120 vUSDy   |

Introducing Xenify, not just an aggregator of aggregators, but a cross-chain aggregator of aggregators! Expertly designed to streamline the swapping process for users traversing multiple chains, Xenify's capabilities are genuinely unparalleled. Powered by ChainZap, an advanced liquidity aggregation protocol, Xenify connects to 19 different aggregators, delivering exceptional liquidity and unbeatable rates across 32 leading chains. Swapping tokens between Ethereum, BNB Chain, Polygon, and many more has never been more effortless.

Imagine this scenario: a user wishes to swap Token-A on Ethereum for Token-B on BNB Chain. With Xenify, the swap is executed with a single click and a single transaction on Ethereum. No more complicated chain navigation or price hunting – Xenify takes care of everything, providing the best available rates.

But wait, there's more! Xenify is not merely a platform for cross-chain swaps; it's a carefully designed ecosystem with distinctive tokenomics, employing swap and burn fee mechanisms to benefit all participants. The optional 0.5% swap fee, which users can elect to pay when executing a swap, not only allows them to earn XNF based on their fee contribution but also rewards XNF stakers with native chain tokens. It's a true win-win!

Here's how it works: When users opt to pay the swap fee, they not only facilitate their transactions but also secure a position in the daily XNF reward cycle. 100% of the 0.5% swap fee will be distributed as native chain rewards to staked XNF holders on supported chains at the end of the daily cycle. That's right – XNF stakers can reap the benefits from every swap on supported chains each and every day!

Furthermore, Xenify's design incorporates an ingenious burn mechanism that enables users to burn XEN and USDy tokens to mint XNF, positioning the XEN burning process as a strategic layer 2 burner of XEN. But here's the best part: a staggering 100% of burn fees are channelled back to XNF stakers.

Xenify's built-in swap and burn fee mechanisms help create a reciprocal environment that rewards platform users with XNF as part of the daily reward cycle, and XNF stakers with a generous 100% of burn fees and swap fees across all supported chains. The team's portion of the swap fee is instrumental in promoting and enhancing the Xenify platform and its associated tokens (XEN, USDy, and XNF), ensuring increased awareness and adoption. This strategy not only fosters user engagement but also amplifies rewards for those deeply involved with the protocol.

In addition to the swap and burn fees, XNF stakers will also benefit from Xenify's strategic integration of the YSL.IO protocol. This secondary layer of Xenify's framework rewards XNF stakers from the yield derived from the rehypothecation of assets deposited in YSL.IO’s state-of-the-art AlphaVaults and MetaVaults, ensuring that even if there are no swaps or burns performed on the platform, XNF stakers still receive Native Chain Rewards. This innovative approach to staking and rewards, paired with Xenify's unique tokenomics model, guarantees that the platform will remain ahead of the curve, attract a growing user base, and contribute to the project's overall success.

In summary, Xenify is the ultimate cross-chain aggregator of aggregators that provides users with unparalleled simplicity and efficiency when swapping tokens across 32 leading chains. With a thoughtfully designed ecosystem, Xenify's unique tokenomics model benefits all participants, from platform users to XNF stakers. Xenify truly offers the best of both worlds: effortless cross-chain token swapping and significant earning potential. Whether executing cross-chain token swaps or burning tokens to mint XNF, every action taken on the Xenify platform contributes to a reciprocal environment of rewards and engagement. With Xenify, users can experience the best rates, earn XNF, and be part of a vibrant community - making it the go-to choice for anyone looking to simplify the cross-chain swapping process while maximising their earning potential.

Xenifiy is a groundbreaking protocol that champions fairness, sustainability, and user engagement. At the heart of its tokenomics structure lies XNF, the platform's native token. XNF serves as the primary incentive for users, with a limited supply of 21.5 million. By engaging in a multitude of protocol activities such as burning, staking and swapping tokens, users are rewarded, fostering a dynamic ecosystem where benefits accrue based on contributions and involvement. With this thoughtful design, Xenify guarantees a level playing field for all users, creating an environment where everyone can reap the rewards and laying the foundation for an equitable, community-driven platform.

![Grey V4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60996729/235287926-6b18081e-ca41-48c7-8dfc-29cc32c598f1.png)

## ◽️ Token Supply

XNF is the lifeblood of the Xenify protocol, and features a limited total supply of 21.5 million tokens. The distribution process for XNF is designed with transparency and equity in mind, ensuring a level playing field for all. 

With no pre-mines, investor allocations, founder allocations, or team allocations, the Xenify protocol fosters an environment of fairness and inclusivity. Users have the opportunity to earn XNF equity by engaging in various activities, such as burning vXEN or vUSDy tokens and swapping tokens across supported chains. This unique token supply model not only promotes active participation but also cultivates a thriving, community-focused ecosystem that everyone can be a part of.

## ◽️ Supply Distribution

Xenify's total supply of XNF tokens is capped at 21.5 million, and strategically divided into three core segments. The allocation comprises 10,500,000 XNF tokens designated for direct burns of vXEN and vUSDy, an additional 10,500,000 XNF tokens reserved for swap volume, and a separate 500,000 XNF tokens earmarked for the launch airdrop. The airdrop will be distributed over a period of 365 days, with eligible participants receiving XNF on each new block.

Drawing inspiration from Bitcoin, Xenify's distribution model adopts the halving principle.  As demonstrated in the graph below, following the 7th halving, Xenify's daily distribution rate stabilises, ensuring a consistent output of 156.25 XNF tokens per day until the maximum supply is reached in month 2112.

With Xenify's halving model applying equally to both direct burns and swap volume distributions, it guarantees a fair distribution of the daily reward pool among active users. This can be in the form of burning tokens to acquire XNF or by utilising Xenify on supported chains to execute swaps. This distinctive strategy has been thoughtfully engineered to ensure an equitable supply distribution centred around users' active participation, underscoring Xenify's steadfast dedication to fostering an equitable and engaged community.

## ◽️ XNF Minting Process and Incentives

The minting process for XNF has been meticulously designed to reward users who actively contribute to Xenify's growth through various activities. This approach promotes an equitable distribution of XNF tokens, cultivating a truly decentralised and community-driven protocol.

Likewise, Xenify's incentive structure has been carefully crafted to motivate users to actively participate in the protocol's growth. Users who engage more with the platform receive a proportionate share of the newly minted XNF tokens, fuelling further involvement.

XNF tokens are distributed in one-day cycles, with the reward pool commencing at 20,000 XNF tokens. This initial allocation is divided into two categories: 50% is designated for users who burn vXEN or vUSDy tokens, while the remaining 50% is apportioned between contributions through the platform's 0.5% swap fee and contributions obtained from the yield generated from the rehypothecation of YSL.IO AlphaVault and MetaVault assets.

With the halving model in place, the daily reward pool diminishes over time and ultimately leads to the complete distribution of the 21.5 million XNF tokens at month 2112. Users that stake XNF tokens will accumulate native token rewards that are generated on the Xenify platform from swap fees and burn fees (e.g., ETH, BNB, MATIC).

Additionally, XNF stakers will benefit from Xenify's strategic integration of the YSL.IO protocol, with 100% of the yield generated from the rehypothecation of assets deposited in YSL.IO AlphaVaults and MetaVaults being routed to Xenify to reward XNF stakers.

This innovative three-pronged incentive model not only helps generate swap volume with users seeking to earn XNF but also rewards user participation through burning and staking. Ultimately, this approach fosters platform growth and cultivates a thriving, engaged user base.

![Grey V4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60996729/235287926-6b18081e-ca41-48c7-8dfc-29cc32c598f1.png)

## ♦️ Burn to earn XNF 
  - The Xenify platform empowers its users by providing the ability to burn vXEN and vUSDy tokens, resulting in the minting of XNF. vXEN and vUSDy are virtual counterparts of XEN and USDy tokens, respectively. Their sole purpose is to facilitate the conversion into XNF tokens. 

  - It's important to note that acquiring vXEN requires XEN tokens or a XEN token variant supported by Xenify, such as bXEN on the BNB Chain. Once you possess vXEN, you can burn it to participate in Xenify's daily distribution of XNF tokens. During this burn process, both the XEN token variant and vXEN token are permanently removed from circulation. Please bear in mind that the conversion rate for vXEN remains fixed, although it may vary depending on the specific version of the XEN token you choose to exchange.

  - Similarly, users interested in obtaining vUSDy will need YSL.IO native tokens like bYSL, xYSL, or USDy. Once you have acquired vUSDy, you can take part in Xenify's daily distribution of XNF tokens by burning it. Just like with vXEN burn process, the protocol ensures that both the bYSL and vUSDy tokens are removed from circulation. It is worth noting that the conversion rate for vUSDy remains fixed, but it depends on the specific YSL.IO native token you opt to exchange.

  - Xenify distinguishes itself by integrating this unique burn mechanism, positioning the protocol as a key player in the strategic layer 1 burning of XEN tokens. This strategic approach extends beyond simply reducing the circulating supply of XEN and USDy tokens. Xenify aspires to unify the XEN and YSL.IO ecosystems, fostering a shared vision that brings both communities together.

![Grey V4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60996729/235287926-6b18081e-ca41-48c7-8dfc-29cc32c598f1.png)

## ♦️ Swap to earn XNF 
  - Xenify is a pioneering cross-chain aggregator of aggregators that transforms the way users experience token exchanges.  With its seamless single-click transactions and the opportunity to earn XNF tokens, Xenify sets itself apart from the competition.

  - By swapping tokens on Xenify and opting to pay the swap fee, users actively contribute to the platform's growth. The entire 0.5% swap fee is distributed as rewards to XNF stakers, empowering those who actively engage with the protocol.

  - However, what truly sets Xenify apart is the remarkable value our users receive by opting to pay the swap fee. When users pay the optional swap fee, they can boost their XNF holdings through daily XNF token distributions, making Xenify a truly rewarding experience. Not only do users enjoy a seamless cross-chain token-swapping experience, but they also earn XNF tokens along the way. 

  - These XNF rewards are automatically staked, enabling users to earn native chain tokens on a daily basis (such as BNB, ETH & MATIC). These native chain rewards are generated through the protocol’s swap fees, burn fees, and reypothecation of assets held by YSL.IO’s AlphaVaults and MetaVaults. As a result, users benefit from the efficiency and competitive rates offered by Xenify while earning rewards and actively participating in shaping the future of Xenify's dynamic ecosystem.

![Grey V4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60996729/235287926-6b18081e-ca41-48c7-8dfc-29cc32c598f1.png)

## ♦️ Stake XNF to earn native tokens 
  - Distinguishing itself from generic aggregators, Xenify takes pride in its innovative staking model that incorporates a burn fee and swap fee distribution mechanism, as well as a secondary layer involving the YSL.IO protocol. This unique approach empowers platform users to execute seamless swaps and embark on a rewarding journey by staking the XNF tokens acquired from daily distributions.

  - XNF token stakers play an essential role in Xenify's long-term growth, and in return reap the benefits of a proportionate share of burn and swap fees generated across all supported chains. As Xenify continues to broaden its reach, an increasing amount of swap volume is guaranteed, with users eager to benefit from a seamless swapping experience while earning XNF on every swap they make. This, in turn, leads to increased Native Chain Rewards for XNF stakers! This equitable model establishes a positive feedback loop, guaranteeing that all participants can benefit from the ecosystem's growth in proportion to their engagement.

  - But that's not all! XNF stakers will also benefit from Xenify's strategic integration of the YSL.IO protocol. This secondary layer of Xenify's framework rewards XNF stakers from the yield derived from the rehypothecation of YSL.IO AlphaVault and MetaVault assets, ensuring that even if there are no swaps or burns performed on the platform, XNF stakers still receive Native Chain Rewards.

  - Here's how it works: every day, the protocol distributes 100% of burn fees (originating from direct burns of vXEN or vUSDy), 50% of YSL.IO AlphaVault and MetaVault yields, and 50% of the platform's swap fees (generated on supported chains) to XNF stakers. These rewards are allocated in the form of native chain tokens—a highly liquid asset—signalling a potentially lucrative return for users staking XNF.

  - Xenify's innovative staking model enables users to stake their XNF tokens for an opportunity to receive a steady stream of exceptional rewards in the form of Native Chain Rewards. This distinctive rewards distribution model not only strengthens the demand and value for XNF but also serves as an added incentive for holders to stake their daily distribution of XNF. This strategy has been integrated to encourage long-term engagement with the protocol while cultivating a growing user base.

## ◽️ Costs of Swapping on Xenify

Xenify offers a ground-breaking token swap solution that not only simplifies cross-chain transactions but also rewards its platform users, all the while nurturing the expansion of its ecosystem. By implementing an optional 0.5% fee on every token swap, Xenify achieves three fundamental objectives: rewarding Xenify platform users, providing native chain rewards to XNF stakers, and fortifying the continuous development of the protocol.

Here's how it works: When a user initiates a token swap on Xenify, they have the option to pay a 0.5% swap fee. This fee is strategically divided to promote future growth and incentivise user participation. A portion of 0.25% is allocated to XNF stakers in the form of native chain tokens, recognising their valuable contribution to the ecosystem. The remaining 0.25% is designated for the Xenify team, funding essential operational expenses such as platform development, marketing campaigns, and community engagement initiatives.

By choosing to pay the nominal 0.5% swap fee, users not only facilitate their transactions but also secure a position in the daily XNF reward cycle. These XNF rewards can be collected by the user or strategically staked to unlock even greater gains from the native tokens generated through swap and burn fees. Consequently, users enjoy the benefits of Xenify's efficiency and competitive rates, all while reaping rewards and actively shaping the evolution of Xenify's dynamic ecosystem.

![Grey V4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60996729/235287926-6b18081e-ca41-48c7-8dfc-29cc32c598f1.png)

## ◽️ Costs of Burning on Xenify

The Xenify protocol enables users to engage in the burning of vXEN or vUSDy tokens to secure XNF from the daily XNF reward cycle. Think of vXEN and vUSDy as virtual counterparts of XEN and USDy, respectively. These tokens have been specifically created for seamless conversion into XNF.

To acquire vXEN, you simply need to have XEN tokens or any XEN token variant supported by Xenify. For instance, if you hold bXEN (the XEN token on the BNB Chain), you can easily convert it into vXEN. Once you obtain vXEN, you can burn it to participate in Xenify's daily distribution of XNF tokens. Both the bXEN and vXEN you contribute will be permanently removed from circulation. It's that simple. Just bear in mind that the conversion rate is fixed, though it may vary depending on the specific version of the XEN token you're exchanging.

Likewise, if you're looking to burn vUSDy, you'll need to possess YSL.IO native tokens such as bYSL, xYSL, or USDy. For example, by holding bYSL, you can easily convert it into vUSDy. Once you possess vUSDy, you can burn it to participate in Xenify's daily distribution of XNF tokens. Both the bYSL and vUSDy you provide will be permanently removed from circulation. Similar to vXEN, the conversion rate for vUSDy remains fixed, but it is contingent upon the particular YSL.IO native token you're exchanging.

By participating in the burning of vXEN and vUSDy, users will encounter specific costs such as transaction gas fees and mandatory burn fees. However, the burn fee calculation has been meticulously designed to not only ensure a transparent and consistent method for token burning but also reward users with attractive discounts on their burn fees of up to 50%.

The burn fee is determined using this formula:

<br>

$$
BF = GS \times (1 - (NB \times CS)) \times NB
$$

<br>

- $BF$ - Burn fee charged for the burn function, paid in the native token of the chain.
- $GS$ - The total amount of gas consumed by the burn function to execute the code.
- $CS$ - The constant 0.00005, used to factor in the discount on the burn fee.
- $NB$ - The number of batches the user burns, influencing the discount in burn fees as the number of batches increases.

<br>

Our ingenious burn fee calculation takes various factors into consideration: including the gas consumed by the burn function, the number of batches, and a discount factor based on the number of batches. This powerful combination serves as a compelling incentive for users to undertake larger burn operations. And the best part? The more batches a user burns, the greater the discount they will enjoy, with potential savings of up to 50% off for 10,000 batches. But what exactly is a batch? A batch represents a fixed number of tokens, either vXEN or vUSDy, that have been set aside for burning. 

Here’s how it works: To initiate the burn function on Xenify, users must have a wallet balance that meets or exceeds the “Number of Batches” multiplied by a fixed number of tokens, depending on the token type being burned. The protocol calculates the Burn fee by multiplying the Gas Spent (GS) by a factor that depends on the Number of Batches (NB) and the constant (CS). The more batches a user burns, the greater the discount on the burn fee. This discount is represented by the term (1 - (NB x CS)).

By implementing this calculation, we ensure that users receive discounts in proportion to the volume of a specific token (vXEN or vUSDy) they burn. Furthermore, we are proud to emphasise that 100% of the burn fees collected are directed toward XNF stakers. This approach not only encourages efficiency but also rewards our valuable contributors, establishing a mutually beneficial ecosystem. Plus, with the maximum discount set at an impressive 50% for 10,000 batches, the more users burn, the more they save! This exciting prospect not only offers substantial benefits for users but also generates enhanced rewards for XNF stakers.

A single batch for vXEN is set at a fixed amount of 2,500,000 XEN, equivalent to 2,500,000 vXEN. However, the amount of vUSDy needed per batch is dynamic, adapting to the ever-changing market price of XEN. This means that the required amount for each daily cycle is tailored to the current market value, ensuring a fair exchange for all users.

Before each cycle begins, the protocol will determine the amount of vUSDy required per batch based on the current market price of XEN. For example, if the market value of 2,500,000 XEN stands at $4.00 at the start of a cycle, you'll only need $4.00 worth of vUSDy per batch during that cycle (equivalent to 4 USDy or 4 vUSDy). But if the value drops to $3.00 at the start of the next cycle, a user will need $3.00 worth of vUSDy per batch during that cycle (equivalent to 3 USDy or 3 vUSDy).

## ◽️ Time-Weighted Burn Fee Discount

Introducing Xenify's time-weighted approach to burn fee discounts, designed to promote fairness and prevent manipulation such as reward front-running or sniping. This innovative method helps curb unfair practices where users strategically time transactions to maximise their rewards or incentives. The protocol calculates the Burn Fee (BF) by multiplying the Gas Spent (GS) by a factor that depends on the Number of Batches (NB) and the constant (CS), as shown in the formula below:

<br>

$$
BF = GS \times (1 - (NB \times CS)) \times NB
$$

<br>

The constant (CS) factors in the discount on the burn fee. The more batches a user burns, the greater the discount on the burn fee, represented by the term (1 - (NB x CS)). The value of the constant varies depending on when a user decides to burn during a cycle. The table below illustrates how the value of the constant changes during a 24-hour cycle. The constant starts at 0.00005 when the cycle begins and decreases by 0.0000025 every hour until it reaches zero after 20 hours. As a result, users will not benefit from the burn fee discount during the last four hours of the cycle.

<br>

| Hour | Constant Value | Max Burn Fee Discount |
|------|----------------|-----------------------|
| 1    | 0.00005        | 50%                   |

| 21   | 0              | 0%                    |
| 22   | 0              | 0%                    |
| 23   | 0              | 0%                    |
| 24   | 0              | 0%                    |

<br>

Let's take a closer look at how the Burn Fee Discount operates in different scenarios:

![Grey V4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60996729/235287926-6b18081e-ca41-48c7-8dfc-29cc32c598f1.png)

## ♦️ Scenario 1: User burns during Hour-1 of a cycle

  - Let’s say you decide to burn 10,000 batches during the first hour of the daily cycle, with a constant of 0.00005 and gas spent at $0.50. Taking the burn fee formula into account, the protocol will determine your Burn Fee (BF) as $2,500:

<br>

$$
BF = $0.50 \times (1 - (10,000 \times 0.00005)) \times 10,000 = $2,500
$$

<br>

![Grey V4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60996729/235287926-6b18081e-ca41-48c7-8dfc-29cc32c598f1.png)

## ♦️ Scenario 2: User burns during Hour-24 of a cycle

  - Now, let’s say you decide to burn 10,000 batches during the last hour of the daily cycle, with a constant of 0 and gas spent at $0.50. Taking the burn fee formula into account, the protocol will determine your Burn Fee (BF) as $5,000:

<br>

$$
BF = $0.50 \times (1 - (10,000 \times 0.00)) \times 10,000 = $5,000
$$

<br>

Comparing these scenarios highlights the benefits of burning batches in the first hour versus the final hour. The maximum savings of 50% are only possible if you burn 10,000 batches during the first hour of the daily cycle. This time-weighted mechanism mitigates unfair practices and enhances fairness, rewarding users who execute burns earlier in the cycle with the greatest discounts.

![Grey V4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60996729/235287926-6b18081e-ca41-48c7-8dfc-29cc32c598f1.png)

## ◽️ XNF Cycle Distribution

Xenify adopts a balanced approach to reward distribution, focusing on essential components of the protocol: burn fees, swap fees, and contributions from the YSL.IO protocol. Each element is granted an allocation of the daily reward cycle distribution, with 50% reserved for token burns, and the remaining 50% apportioned between swap fee contributions and contributions from YSL.IO vaults. For instance, if the daily XNF cycle distribution is 20,000 XNF tokens, Xenify will divide the rewards, allocating 10,000 XNF for burn fee contributions and 10,000 XNF between swap fee contributions and YSL.IO vault contributions.

To ascertain each user's allocation of the daily distribution of XNF tokens, the protocol will perform a series of calculations. These calculations will be based on the swap and burn contributions made during the cycle. The protocol will consolidate these contributions to accurately compute the total XNF distribution for each user. This methodical approach ensures an equitable distribution, crediting both the user's active engagement in token burns and their contribution in terms of swap fees.

The protocol calculates the burn contribution (BC) of a specific user in a cycle, based on the total XNF tokens distributed (TCD), the total number of batches burned by all users (TBB), and the number of batches burned by the specific user (UBB). Here's the formula explained in detail:

<br>

$$
BC = (TCD \div 2) \times (UBB \div TBB)
$$

<br>

**Where:**

- *BC* - represents the burn contribution of the user.
- *TCD* - is the total amount of XNF tokens distributed in a cycle.
- *UBB* - is the number of batches a specific user has burned in a cycle.
- *TBB* - is the total number of batches burned in a cycle by all users.

<br>

Here’s how it works: The protocol calculates the burn contribution by first dividing the total tokens distributed during a cycle (TCD) by 2, as half of the XNF daily reward cycle is allocated to participants that burn vXEN or vUSDy. It then calculates the proportion of batches burned by the specific user (UBB) to the total batches burned by all users (TBB). This results in a value per batch burned. Finally, the protocol multiplies these two values to determine the user's individual burn contribution within that cycle (BC).

The calculation of the swap contribution follows a similar logic, whereby the protocol calculates the swap contribution (SC) of a specific user in a cycle, based on the total XNF tokens distributed (TCD), the total swap fees paid by all users (TSF), and the swap fees paid by the specific user (USF). Here's the formula explained in detail:

<br>

$$
SC = (TCD \div 2) \times (USF \div TSF)
$$

<br>

**Where:**

- *SC* - represents the swap contribution of the user.
- *TCD* - is the total amount of XNF tokens distributed in a cycle.
- *USF* - is the swap fees paid by a specific user in a cycle.
- *TSF* - is the total swap fees paid in a cycle by all users.

<br>

Here’s how it works: The protocol calculates the user's swap contribution (SC) by first dividing the total XNF tokens distributed (TCD) by 2, as half of the XNF daily reward cycle is allocated to participants that perform swaps on supported chains. It then multiplies the result by the ratio of the user's swap fees (USF) to the total swap fees (TSF) paid by all users. This generates a specific value for each unit of swap fee paid and helps in determining the proportion of XNF tokens a user receives based on their individual contribution to the swap fees in a given cycle.

## ◽️ Automatic Staking of XNF Tokens

Unclaimed and staked XNF tokens both contribute to a user's accumulation of native chain rewards, with each user's share determined by their stake in the total reward pool. The Xenify protocol has been designed with users in mind, incorporating an automatic staking system to ensure their allocation of XNF tokens is seamlessly staked on their behalf upon distribution.

This means that token holders can enjoy the benefits of earning native chain rewards the moment they receive their XNF tokens, eliminating the hassle of collecting and staking XNF tokens during each cycle. For users who prefer a more hands-on approach, manual staking of tokens is also available. With this auto-staking mechanism, users can compound their XNF stake and increase their share of the rewards.

When the Xenify protocol automatically stakes XNF tokens, it adheres to the one-cycle unstaking rule. This means that staked XNF tokens are held for one full daily cycle, even during any 'gap cycles'. Once the required staking cycle is complete, users can choose to unstake their XNF tokens and regain full ownership.

## ◽️ Unstaking XNF Tokens

To guarantee a secure and effective ecosystem, staked XNF tokens are held for one complete daily cycle, even during any 'gap cycles'. Staked tokens begin to accumulate native chain rewards within the same cycle they are staked. These native chain rewards are collected into a reward pool during each cycle, and subsequently distributed by the protocol among XNF stakers at the end of the daily cycle.

Once the compulsory staking cycle has concluded, users can opt to unstake their XNF tokens and regain full ownership. At this stage, all earned native chain rewards are instantly sent to the user, ensuring a seamless and rewarding experience.

## ◽️ Collecting XNF Token

Collecting XNF is not necessary, as all XNF tokens are automatically staked for the user by the protocol with each daily distribution. This auto-staking mechanism enables users to enjoy an allocation of the native chain rewards accumulated during that cycle. Alternatively, users can choose to collect or unstake their XNF for trading purposes once the mandatory staking cycle for the tokens has ended. Regardless of the preference, Xenify provides flexibility and control for every user.

## ◽️ Claiming Native Chain Rewards

Xenify empowers users to effortlessly claim and withdraw their accumulated native chain rewards at their convenience. However, be aware that a 25% Claim Fee will be applied when claiming your native chain rewards. To sidestep the 25% Claim Fee, simply click the "Recycle" button. This enables you to use your accumulated native chain tokens to acquire XNF by participating in the daily burn of vUSDy, avoiding the Claim Fee entirely. Throughout each cycle, the native tokens collected from this fee are stored in a temporary pool. 

At the end of the cycle, these tokens are exclusively distributed among XNF stakers who have employed the Recycle function during the cycle. This unique distribution occurs during the protocol's daily distribution of native chain rewards, with each eligible participant receiving a share based on their position. For instance, if a user recycles their rewards during a cycle, they will be included in the distribution of proceeds generated from the Claim Fee at the end of that cycle.

## ◽️ Recycling Native Chain Rewards

Opting to recycle your native chain rewards allows you to bypass the 25% claim fee while using your accumulated rewards to participate in the daily vUSDy burn and acquire XNF tokens. Plus, by utilising the recycle function, you'll also receive a share of the claim fees generated during a cycle. To take advantage of this recycle mechanism, you will need to have an adequate balance of native chain rewards to obtain a minimum of one batch and cover the associated burn fee within the vUSDy burn process. If you don't have enough native chain tokens to meet these requirements, the recycle mechanism will be unavailable.

![Grey V4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60996729/235287926-6b18081e-ca41-48c7-8dfc-29cc32c598f1.png)

## ♦️ Recycle Process Overview

  - You choose to recycle your native chain rewards.
  - By utilising Chainlink’s price oracle, the protocol will first determine the value of your native chain rewards in dollar terms.
  - The protocol then mints an optimal amount of vUSDy batches based on the dollar value of your recycled contribution. This will be dependent on the current value of one batch of vUSDy, with the protocol rounding down to the closest batch count. For instance if 2,500,000 XEN (1 batch) equates to 5 vUSDy, and your native chain rewards are equivalent to $101.00, the protocol will mint 100 vUSDy, equivalent to 20 batches of vUSDy. This is the optimal amount of batches from your native chain reward balance, with the protocol rounding down from 20.2 ($101.00/5) to an optimal batch amount of 20.
  - 100% of the minted vUSDy will be burned to acquire XNF during the burning cycle, with the protocol collecting the burn fee from your balance of native chain rewards.
  - The remaining native chain rewards after the burn process will be deposited into the XNF HydraVault on YSL.IO. For instance, if $20.00 from your $101.00 native chain reward recycle contribution was used towards the burn fee of 100 vUSDy, the remaining $81.00 BNB will be deposited into the XNF HydraVault.
  - The associated HydraVault receipt tokens (XNF-LP) are burnt, this means the USDy minted from the deposit remains in the vault, resulting in the Perpetual Ratio for the vault increasing.
  - You’ll receive XNF tokens at the end of the daily burn cycle based on the vUSDy burned from your recycled contribution.
  - The XNF tokens are automatically staked on your behalf, and subsequently you’ll receive your share of daily native chain rewards, as well as your share of the native chain tokens (eg. BNB) accumulated from the claim fee during the cycle.

## ◽️ Native Token Reward Distribution

During each cycle, the accumulation of native reward tokens unfolds, wherein the reward pool gradually accumulates tokens collected from burn and swap fees. This will continue to grow with every transaction during the cycle, be it a swap or a burn. 

As the cycle concludes, the yield generated from the rehypothecation of YSL.IO AlphaVault and MetaVault assets is added to the reward pool. Subsequently, the total sum of the reward pool is carefully distributed among XNF stakers based on the total number of XNF tokens an individual has staked within the protocol.

This will encompass both uncollected and staked tokens, ensuring fairness and inclusivity. With this unique reward structure, Xenify is able to strengthen the demand and value for XNF and provide a compelling incentive for holders to actively participate in the protocol. This in turn, encourages long-term engagement while cultivating a growing user base and fortifying the protocol's growth.

# ◽️ Liquidity Provisioning
![Line Divider - Filled](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60996729/233879462-b465c484-4c2f-4cd2-a126-19529e333d64.png)

In a strategic effort to ensure sufficient liquidity for all supported chains, Xenify has crafted a unique liquidity provisioning event to coincide with each launch. This forward-thinking initiative has been designed to facilitate the seamless distribution of XNF tokens in alignment with the platform's liquidity needs, effectively catering to the demands of users across every chain.

For this exclusive, one-day event, half of the 20,000 XNF tokens typically reserved for the daily reward cycle distribution will be utilised to bolster the platform's liquidity. The remaining 10,000 XNF tokens will be allocated to individuals who burn vXEN or vUSDy during the one-day event. This offers an unprecedented opportunity to secure a substantial share of the native chain rewards that have accumulated during Day 1 and from swaps executed on Xenify prior to the launch.

By burning vXEN or vUSDy on Day 1, users will not only receive an allotment of XNF tokens at the end of the day, but will also be in line to secure a portion of the native chain rewards (e.g., ETH, BNB, MATIC) distributed at the conclusion of Day 1. With a limited number of XNF holders or stakers on Day 1, only those who engage in the burning of vXEN or vUSDy on Day 1 can reap the benefits of the accrued native chain rewards, collected from swap fees both prior to and during Day 1.

Subsequent to the event, the standard XNF reward distribution cycle will recommence and continue thereafter. This entails XNF stakers receiving a share of the burn and swap fees (based on the fees collected during the previous cycle), while users performing a burn or swap will earn XNF (in accordance with their contributions during each cycle). Through the successful execution of these events on each chain, Xenify aims to secure protocol-owned liquidity across the entire ecosystem, laying the groundwork for sustainable, long-term growth.

![Grey V4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60996729/235287926-6b18081e-ca41-48c7-8dfc-29cc32c598f1.png)

## ◽️ Day 1: XNF Liquidity, Airdrop and Rewards

As Day 1 comes to an end, four crucial events take place. Firstly, the protocol generates protocol-owned liquidity. This involves the protocol collecting the sum of all native tokens received from burn fees incurred during Day 1 (when users burn vXEN or vUSDy) and pairing it with the 10,000 XNF tokens allocated specifically for the liquidity provisioning event. The initial price of the XNF token will be set at $1.00, and all associated LP tokens acquired will be retained by Xenify as protocol-owned liquidity.

The second important event is the distribution of the 10,000 XNF tokens designated for those who burned vXEN or vUSDy on Day 1. These XNF tokens will be automatically staked by the protocol on the user's behalf.

Next, the protocol will distribute Native Chain Rewards among the XNF stakers. It is crucial to note that at this stage, there will be a limited number of XNF stakers based on the contributions received from the burn process during Day 1. In other words, only individuals who choose to contribute on Day 1 will secure an allocation of the Day 1 distribution of native chain rewards.

This initial reward distribution will not only include native chain tokens collected from swap fees during Day 1 and the yield generated from the rehypothecation of YSL.IO AlphaVaults and MetaVaults assets, but also includes native chain tokens that have been gradually accruing from swaps executed on the chain prior to Xenify's deployment.

Lastly, the protocol will initiate the distribution of the Xenify Airdrop. The 500,000 XNF allocated for the airdrop will be shared among users based on their swap contributions on and before Day 1. The airdrop will be distributed to participants over a period of 365 days, with each eligible participant receiving XNF on each new block.

![Grey V4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60996729/235287926-6b18081e-ca41-48c7-8dfc-29cc32c598f1.png)

## ◽️ Day 2: Return to Normal Distribution

Starting on Day 2, the protocol will initiate its default XNF reward distribution schedule. This involves reserving 10,000 XNF for users who burn vXEN and vUSDy tokens, while an additional 10,000 XNF will be apportioned between swap contributions and YSL.IO AlphaVault and MetaVault contributions.

As Day 2 concludes, two significant events will unfold. First, the protocol will distribute 20,000 XNF tokens as part of its default XNF cycle distribution. In this distribution, 10,000 XNF will be allocated to those who performed burns on Day 2, and 10,000 XNF will be apportioned between those who executed eligible swaps during Day 2 as well as the YSL.IO protocol based on the contribution received from the rehypothecation of its AlphaVault and MetaVault assets. These 20,000 XNF tokens will be automatically staked by the protocol on the user's behalf.

Next, the protocol will distribute Native Chain Rewards among XNF stakers. These rewards will include the fees collected from swaps and burns made during Day 2, as well as the yield generated from the rehypothecation of YSL.IO AlphaVaults and MetaVaults assets on Day 2. These rewards will be exclusively distributed to those who have staked XNF, which is only attainable if a user contributed to the burn process during Day 1 and Day 2.

# ◽️ Genesis Xenify Airdrop

To kickstart liquidity creation on the Genesis chain and encourage user participation, we're conducting an exclusive Genesis Xenify Airdrop event, featuring 500,000 XNF tokens on the BNB Chain where the XNF contract will be first deployed! 

This exclusive airdrop is available to those who engage in swaps and pay the 0.5% swap fee on Xenify on or before Day 1 (prior to the XNF contract deployment on the BNB Chain), and the YSL.IO protocol based on the yield contributed from the rehypothecation of AlphaVault and MetaVault assets. 

An astounding 100% of the accrued native tokens generated from the optional swap fee and YSL.IO AlphaVaults and MetaVaults will be collected until deployment. These tokens will then be distributed as part of the first native token reward distribution to users who contribute to the burn process during the Liquidity Provisioning Event on Day 1. This groundbreaking approach not only incentivises early user engagement through swap participation but also helps Xenify establish a robust liquidity pool from day one. 

The gradual accumulation of native token rewards generated from the swap fees and rehypothecation of YSL.IO AlphaVault and MetaVault assets, will motivate users to burn vXEN or vUSDy on Day 1, ultimately leading to the creation of XNF protocol-owned liquidity. With 100% of the Day 1 burn fees used for liquidity creation, a powerful positive feedback loop emerges. As more users swap on Xenify to join the airdrop, it attracts additional users to burn on Day 1, resulting in increased burn fees and ultimately, greater liquidity generation.

At the end of Day 1, the Genesis Xenify Airdrop distribution will commence. The airdrop distribution will be based on the sum total contributions received from the swap fee and yield contributed from YSL.IO AlphaVaults and MetaVaults. Each eligible swap participant will receive their share of the airdrop in proportion to their individual swap contributions and the YSL.IO protocol will receive an allocation based on the yield contributed from the rehypothecation of AlphaVault and MetaVault assets.

The 500,000 XNF tokens will be distributed as locked tokens, gradually unlocking with each new block over a period of 730 days. Please note that locked XNF tokens will not be eligible for staking. For example, if you receive 100 locked XNF tokens from the airdrop, you can expect approximately 0.13699 XNF tokens to be unlocked in your wallet each day (100 XNF tokens / 730 days = 0.13699 XNF tokens per day).

Introducing [Phoenix Apes](https://docs.ysl.io/protocol-features/Phoenix-NFT), the exclusive NFT collectible that unites the Xenify and YSL.IO communities. By owning one of these extraordinary NFTs, users of Xenify will unlock a daily amplified burn effect, exponentially boosting their batch count by up to 100 when burning vXEN or vUSDy. Moreover, owning or renting a minimum of 4 of these highly coveted NFTs will grant you an even greater amplification, with your wallet receiving a daily bonus of up to 1,000 batches.

Furthermore, holders of the Phoenix NFT will enjoy a range of extra perks. First and foremost, all holders will have a guaranteed allocation of XNF on every chain Xenify launches through the Day 1 bonus contribution. Additionally, they will have the opportunity to earn USDC rewards every 8 hours and bypass the Sigma Exit Rate on the YSL.IO protocol. These additional benefits enhance user engagement while making significant contributions to the growth of both the Xenify and YSL.IO ecosystems.

Every wallet that holds a Phoenix Ape NFT is subject to a Weekly Outbound Quota (WOQ) that permits a single outbound transaction involving a Phoenix Ape NFT every 7 days. Outbound transactions include transferring a Phoenix Ape NFT to another wallet or selling the NFT. Please note that while the WOQ restriction is in effect, wallet holders are still permitted to bridge the utility of their Phoenix Ape NFT(s) to another chain. In short, bridging the utility of an NFT to a different chain neither triggers the WOQ nor impacts the user's ability to bridge their Phoenix Ape NFT(s) utility.

And here's the best part: Your daily batch bonus, whether you possess one NFT or four NFTs, can seamlessly be bridged to any chain that Xenify launches. With your burn bonus resetting each day, you'll have the opportunity to reap the benefits of this amplified burn effect across all chains Xenify launches on a daily basis!

## ◽️ Day 1 Bonus Contribution

By merely holding a Phoenix Ape NFT, you automatically secure 100 complimentary batches for Xenify’s Day 1 Burns. And guess what? This applies to all the chains Xenify launches. So, if Xenify happens to launch on 8 chains, you’ll receive 800 bonus batches!

And here’s the best part: You don’t even need to burn any vXEN or vUSDy on Day 1! That’s right, by simply holding a Phoenix Ape NFT you will be rewarded with XNF tokens through the contribution of your 100 bonus batches. But that’s not all! You’ll also be eligible for an allocation of the Native Chain Rewards distributed on Day 1 across every chain! It’s an opportunity you don’t want to miss!

Now, you might be wondering, why are we providing such incredible benefits to Phoenix Ape NFT holders? The answer is simple: A significant amount of the $2,500 USDC generated from each NFT purchase has been dedicated to funding the initial audit of Xenify and its development.

## ◽️ Daily Amplified Burn Effect

Phoenix Ape NFT holders unlock an exclusive amplified burn effect when they choose to burn vXEN or vUSDy on Xenify. This unique advantage empowers NFT holders to secure a larger share of the daily distribution of XNF, while also benefiting from significant discounts on their burn fees. By bridging both communities, this exceptional benefit fosters unity and fuels growth for both protocols.

Here's how it works: When Phoenix Ape NFT holders decide to burn vXEN or vUSDy on Xenify, they unlock a daily burn bonus that doubles their batch count (NB). The bonus is capped at 100 daily batches per NFT ID. Once a user uses up all 100 daily bonus batches allocated to their Phoenix Ape NFT, that specific NFT will no longer offer an amplified burn for that day.

Looking for extra firepower? We've got fantastic news! By owning or renting at least 4 of these highly sought-after NFTs, you'll benefit from even greater amplification, with your wallet receiving a daily bonus of 1,000 batches. This effectively replaces the default 100 daily bonus batches reserved for each of your four NFT IDs. In short, if you hold 4 NFTs, your total daily bonus will be capped at 1,000 batches, not 1,400 batches.

Remember, the more batches you burn, the more you save on burn fees. By holding 4 NFTs, you can achieve maximum savings of 50% off your burn fees by burning just 9,000 batches instead of the usual 10,000 required for a 50% discount. Plus, with Phoenix Ape NFTs having a limited supply of 520, there can only be a maximum of 130 wallet addresses that can seize this extra firepower.

And here's the best part: Your daily batch bonus, whether you have one NFT or four NFTs, can be seamlessly bridged to any chain that Xenify launches. Let's say Xenify expands to Polygon and you hold 4 Phoenix Ape NFTs. Once you've exhausted your daily 1,000 batch bonus on the BNB Chain, you can easily bridge the utility of your NFTs to Polygon and enjoy 1,000 bonus batches there. With your multiplier resetting every day, you'll have the opportunity to reap the benefits of this amplified burn effect across all chains Xenify launches on a daily basis!

In summary, holders of Phoenix Ape NFTs not only enjoy an increased share of the daily XNF distribution but also unlock greater discounts on the burn fee by burning a larger amount of batches. The maximum discount is capped at 50% for 10,000 batches, and it's represented by the term (1 - (NB x CS)) in the protocols burn fee formula:

<br>

$$
BF = GS \times (1 - (NB \times CS)) \times NB
$$

**Where:**

- $BF$ - Burn Fee, the fee charged for the burn function, paid in the native token of the blockchain.
- $GS$ - Gas Spent, the total amount of gas consumed by the burn function to execute the code.
- $CS$ - A constant value of 0.00005, used to factor in the discount on the burn fee.
- $NB$ - Number of Batches, the number of batches the user burns, influencing the discount in burn fees as the number of batches increases.

## ◽️ Example: Amplified Burn Effect

Let's take a closer look at how the amplified burn works in different scenarios:

![Grey V4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60996729/235287926-6b18081e-ca41-48c7-8dfc-29cc32c598f1.png)

## ♦️ Scenario 1: If you hold between 1 and 3 Phoenix Ape NFTs

  - Each Phoenix Ape NFT is equipped with a daily bonus multiplier limited to 100 batches. When burning a specific number of batches, the protocol first verifies if any of your NFTs possess a bonus balance. If so, the protocol uses your bonus balance to increase your batch count. 

  - For instance, imagine you have a daily bonus of 100 batches on your NFT and opt to burn 10 batches. The protocol will effectively double your batch count to 20 batches, by utilising 10 of your daily bonus batches. Consequently, 10 batches from your NFT ID's daily bonus will be deducted, leaving 90 bonus batches for that NFT on that day.

  - However, if you decide to burn an amount exceeding your bonus balance, the protocol will consume the entire balance of your NFT. For example, if your current daily bonus balance is 90 batches and you choose to burn 5,000 batches, the burn process will count it as 5,090 batches, using up the entire 90 batches from your NFT's bonus balance. As a result, 90 bonus batches allocated to the NFT ID will be removed, leaving zero bonus batches for that NFT on that day. Fear not, your bonus batch count will reset to 100 the following day.

  - Additionally, you have the option to bridge your NFT's utility to another chain where Xenify has launched. By doing so, you can access an extra 100 daily bonus batches on that day, effectively granting you 200 daily bonus batches for your NFT. For example, if you've exhausted your daily bonus on the BNB Chain, simply bridge your NFT's utility to Polygon and receive 1,000 daily bonus batches on Polygon. This process can be repeated for each chain where Xenify has been deployed.

![Grey V4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60996729/235287926-6b18081e-ca41-48c7-8dfc-29cc32c598f1.png)

## ♦️ Scenario 2: If you hold 4 or more Phoenix Ape NFTs

  - If you own or rent 4 Phoenix Ape NFTs, burning batches becomes even more rewarding. Your wallet will receive a daily bonus of 1,000 batches. This effectively replaces the default 100 daily bonus batches reserved for each of your NFT IDs. In short, if you hold 4 or more NFTs in your wallet, your total daily bonus will be capped at 1,000 batches for that wallet. When you choose to burn a batch amount that is less than your current daily bonus, the protocol will double your batch count by using an equivalent amount. 

  - For instance, if you have 4 NFTs and a daily bonus of 1,000 batches, burning 1 batch will be counted as 2 batches during the burn process. This means that 1 batch will be deducted from your daily NFTs bonus, leaving you with 999 bonus batches for the day on that chain.

  - On the other hand, if you decide to burn a batch amount greater than your current daily bonus, the protocol will utilise your entire bonus balance. Let's say you have 4 NFTs and a daily bonus of 1,000 batches. If you choose to burn the equivalent of 6,000 batches, it will be counted as 7,000 batches during the burn process. The protocol will use your entire daily batch bonus of 1,000 for this. As a result, you won't have any bonus batches remaining to use for that particular day on that chain. But don't worry, once the next day begins, your bonus batch count will reset back to 1,000.

  - Additionally, you can choose to bridge the utility of your 4 NFTs to another chain that Xenify has launched. By doing this, you can use an additional 1,000 daily bonus batches on that day, effectively giving you 2,000 daily bonus batches. For example, if you've used up your daily bonus on the BNB Chain, you can simply bridge your NFTs' utility to Polygon and receive 1,000 daily bonus batches on Polygon. You can repeat this process for each chain where Xenify has been deployed.

## ◽️ Claimable USDC Rewards

The Phoenix NFT has been designed to be a game-changer in the world of NFTs. With its innovative rental mechanism, this unique NFT actively supports the YSL.IO ecosystem and allows users to generate rental income, whilst renters enjoy the advantage of bypassing the protocol’s Sigma Exit Rate. When a Phoenix Ape NFT is rented through the YSL.IO marketplace, a portion of the user's rental income is collected as tax. Combined with a share of royalty taxes from OpenSea, these earnings are then distributed among all Phoenix Ape NFT holders as USDC rewards on the BNB Chain.

These USDC rewards will be available for holders to claim at the end of each 8-hour epoch. And here's the cherry on top: even if a user decides to bridge their Phoenix NFT from the BNB chain to amplify burns with Xenify on another chain, they'll still be eligible for the USDC distribution. In simpler terms, the claimable USDC rewards on the BNB Chain will be reserved for all addresses that hold the Phoenix Ape NFT, regardless of whether they bridge utility to another chain.

![Grey V4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60996729/235287926-6b18081e-ca41-48c7-8dfc-29cc32c598f1.png)

## ◽️ Bypassing the Sigma Exit Rate
    
The YSL.IO protocol has been purpose-built to provide stability and resilience for all participants. The protocol showcases an innovative Price Stability Model (PSM) that not only aims to stabilise the price of native tokens (YSL, xYSL, bYSL, and USDy), but also guarantees users experience high exit liquidity and preserves the long-term growth of treasury-owned liquidity.

A crucial component of the PSM is the Sigma Exit Rate, which restricts token sales from a wallet by considering the user's acquisition or last sale of the token. However, privileged Phoenix Ape NFT holders can enjoy the freedom to sell up to 100% of their xYSL, bYSL, or USDy tokens without being subjected to the Sigma Exit Rate. This exclusive feature grants users ultimate flexibility and control over their YSL.IO native token holdings.

We understand that you may have questions about Xenify, its features, and its potential. To help you navigate our platform, we've compiled a list of frequently asked questions that provide clarity and insights into Xenify and its ecosystem.

<br>

## ◽️ Does XNF have an initial supply?
- No, Xenify does not have an initial supply, and there is no pre-mine of XNF tokens. Instead, the protocol distributes XNF tokens through a daily reward to users that participate in the ecosystem through direct burns of vXEN and vUSDy or swapping of tokens via the Xenify aggregator. This approach ensures a fair distribution model and encourages active user engagement in the protocol.

![Grey V4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60996729/235287926-6b18081e-ca41-48c7-8dfc-29cc32c598f1.png)

## ◽️ What does the recycle button do?
- The recycle button is an intuitive feature designed with user-centricity at its core. By clicking the recycle button, XNF stakers can instantly convert their accumulated native chain rewards into staked XNF with a single click. The protocol will first sell your accrued native chain rewards, such as ETH, BNB, and MATIC, and use the proceeds to purchase XNF. Subsequently, the newly acquired XNF will be staked on your behalf, streamlining the process for your convenience.

![Grey V4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60996729/235287926-6b18081e-ca41-48c7-8dfc-29cc32c598f1.png)

## ◽️ Why will XNF appreciate in value?
  - The value of XNF holds the potential to appreciate significantly due to Xenify’s innovative tokenomics, thriving ecosystem, and the increasing demand for native chain rewards. With Xenify's cutting-edge cross-chain aggregator, users can enjoy seamless token swapping and engage in various rewarding activities, which drives protocol adoption and ultimately the value of XNF.

  - Additionally, the scarcity of XNF tokens, brought about by halving events, is likely to boost the token's value as more users choose Xenify as their preferred platform for swapping tokens. This will lead to more native chain rewards for XNF stakers, resulting in a growing demand for XNF tokens. Consequently, the token value is poised to rise due to demand, cementing Xenify's position as a promising project within the XEN ecosystem.

![Grey V4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60996729/235287926-6b18081e-ca41-48c7-8dfc-29cc32c598f1.png)

## ◽️ If I make a stake now when can I unstake?
  - Staked XNF tokens are held for one full daily cycle, even during any 'gap cycles'. After one complete daily cycle has passed, users have the option to unstake their XNF tokens, regaining full ownership. Upon unstaking, all earned native chain rewards are promptly delivered to the user.

![Grey V4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60996729/235287926-6b18081e-ca41-48c7-8dfc-29cc32c598f1.png)

## ◽️ How do I generate rewards with Xenify?
  - Users can generate rewards with Xenify by staking their XNF tokens. In doing so, they will receive native chain tokens such as ETH, BNB, and MATIC on each daily cycle. Each staker will receive a share of the rewards generated from the burn and swap fees collected through the protocol, as well as a share of the yield contributed from the rehypothecation of assets held within YSL.IO AlphaVaults and MetaVaults. This incentive model encourages engagement and contributes to the protocol's long-term growth and sustainability.

![Grey V4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60996729/235287926-6b18081e-ca41-48c7-8dfc-29cc32c598f1.png)

## ◽️ If I make a stake now when will I receive rewards?
  - When you stake XNF tokens, you will receive rewards at the end of the same cycle in which you make the stake. These rewards comprise native chain tokens generated from both swap fees and burn fees collected during the cycle, as well as the yield generated from the rehypothecation of YSL.IO AlphaVault and MetaVault assets. Throughout the cycle, these rewards accumulate in a reward pool, and the protocol distributes the entire reward pool of native chain tokens among XNF stakers at the end of the cycle, ensuring a fair and transparent allocation.

![Grey V4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60996729/235287926-6b18081e-ca41-48c7-8dfc-29cc32c598f1.png)

## ◽️ Are there different ways to participate with Xenify?
- Yes, there are several ways to participate with Xenify, including:

  - Utilise the Xenify aggregator to perform seamless single-click swaps and earn XNF in the process.
  - Engage in direct burns of vXEN or vUSDy to acquire XNF.
  - Stake XNF tokens to earn native chain tokens such as ETH, BNB and MATIC.
  - Purchase a Phoenix Ape NFT to unlock daily amplified burns and more.
  - Contribute to the protocol's growth through community initiatives.

![Grey V4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60996729/235287926-6b18081e-ca41-48c7-8dfc-29cc32c598f1.png)

## ◽️ What happens if there are no token swaps, burns, or yield contributions from YSL.IO AlphaVault and MetaVault assets during a daily cycle?

- In the unlikely event that no swaps occur on Xenify, no users burn either vXEN or vUSDy, and the protocol does not receive any yields from the rehypothecation of YSL.IO AlphaVault and MetaVault assets, the daily XNF cycle distribution will not be carried out. In this scenario, the XNF tokens scheduled for distribution during that cycle will simply not be minted. As a result, the total supply of XNF will decrease by the amount that was intended to be distributed in that cycle.

- For instance, if the daily allocation for a cycle is set at 20,000 XNF, with half allocated for burning activities and the other half reserved for contributions from YSL.IO AlphaVault and MetaVault assets, as well as those who engage in swaps on Xenify, and if no swaps or burns occur during that cycle, the 20,000 XNF will not be minted or distributed. Instead, the total supply of XNF will be reduced by 20,000 XNF at the conclusion of the cycle.

## ◽️ Direct Burns 

  - When a token is burned it's usually sent to an inactive address and removed from circulation, effectively reducing the total supply by the amount burned. On Xenify, Direct Burns happen when users purposefully burn tokens (vXEN or vUSDy) to promote the growth of the protocol.  As a reward for their commitment to the protocol, users receive XNF tokens in exchange for their burned vXEN or vUSDy tokens.

## ◽️ Proof of Burn

  - Proof of Burn is a commitment mechanism where users burn tokens to show their support for the protocol. In exchange, they receive equity.

## ◽️ Swap Volume 
  
  - Swap volume refers to the total value of token swaps executed on the Xenify platform. It serves as the basis for distributing XNF tokens to users during the daily reward cycle.

## ◽️ First Principles 

  - First principles in crypto are the fundamental concepts that underpin decentralised digital currencies. They focus on permissionless access, transparency, trustlessness, decentralisation, and immutability. These principles guide the growth and innovation of cryptocurrencies, enabling informed decision-making and shaping the future of decentralised finance.

## ◽️ Interoperability

  - Interoperability is the ability of different systems, networks, or platforms to seamlessly work together. It allows for the exchange of data, assets, and information without barriers.

![Grey V4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60996729/235287926-6b18081e-ca41-48c7-8dfc-29cc32c598f1.png)

## ◽️ Smart Contracts 

  - Smart Contracts are digital agreements that automatically execute when specific conditions are met, allowing two or more parties to exchange things like money, property, or shares in a transparent and hassle-free way, without needing a middleman. These contracts are like mini-programs stored on a blockchain, and they run as soon as the agreed-upon terms are fulfilled. By automating the process, everyone involved can be confident in the outcome without delays or interference from intermediaries.

## ◽️ DeFi (Decentralised Finance) 

  - DeFi, short for Decentralised Finance, is a financial system that cuts out the middlemen by using blockchain technology. It blends traditional banking with blockchain, replacing some parts of the usual financial system with smart contracts on a blockchain. DeFi delivers financial services on a blockchain, offering a more open, transparent, and user-friendly alternative to traditional financial services.
