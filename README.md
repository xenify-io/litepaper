## ⭐️ Emphasis on Equity and Long-term Investment

Xenify places great emphasis on equity and long-term investments. We believe in empowering our users to reap the rewards of our protocol's growth and token value appreciation. By holding a stake in Xenify, users have the opportunity to become a part of our success and stand to potentially generate passive income through staking XNF. To accomplish this, we've developed a range of robust features designed to maximise your benefits as a Xenify user:

![Grey V4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60996729/235287926-6b18081e-ca41-48c7-8dfc-29cc32c598f1.png)

## ✨ Locking XNF Tokens

- Xenify introduces a dynamic rewards system that offers significant advantages to XNF holders. By locking XNF tokens, users become eligible to receive an impressive 50% of burn fees and swap fees generated on supported chains, every single day.

![Grey V4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60996729/235287926-6b18081e-ca41-48c7-8dfc-29cc32c598f1.png)

## ✨ Recycling Native Rewards

  - Recycling your native rewards offers a wide range of benefits and is a strategic decision to consider. By choosing to recycle your rewards, you not only bypass the 25% claim fee, but you also unlock the ability to participate in the burn cycle without providing additional native tokens to cover the mandatory burn fee. Unlike the normal burn process, our protocol uniquely deducts the burn fee from your recycled rewards, enabling fee-free participation. 

  - Recycling also provides a gateway to exclusive daily distributions. You'll gain access to additional rewards, including veXNF and XEN tokens drawn from protocol-owned liquidity. Plus, you'll receive native tokens generated from the 25% claim fee when you opt to recycle during the first hour of a cycle. It's an array of rewards that keeps on giving.

  - But here’s the best part, when you recycle, your rewards go a long way in fortifying our ecosystem. Your contribution will not only boost rewards for veXNF holders, but also stimulates the proliferation of XNF and XEN protocol-owned liquidity, and supports our team's operational efforts. It's a strategic move that strengthens Xenify from the inside out.

  - In a nutshell, recycling doesn’t only enhance your XNF position through fee-free burning. It also unlocks exclusive access to rewards and actively contributes to the growth of Xenify. This forges a win-win situation where your contributions are rewarded, and the protocol advances, creating a thriving ecosystem for all participants.

![Grey V4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60996729/235287926-6b18081e-ca41-48c7-8dfc-29cc32c598f1.png)

## ✨ Token Burning

- Xenify empowers users to effortlessly burn their XEN or YSL tokens directly from their wallets to participate in the daily burn auction. This burn mechanism goes beyond simply reducing the circulating supply of XEN and YSL tokens; it embodies a strategic approach that unites the YSL.IO community and the broader XEN communities across all chains, fostering a shared vision that unifies both ecosystems.

![Grey V4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60996729/235287926-6b18081e-ca41-48c7-8dfc-29cc32c598f1.png)

## ✨ Cross-Chain Swapping

- Xenify is the ultimate solution for cross-chain swapping, allowing you to exchange tokens across 52 different chains with ease and efficiency. Our streamlined approach offers a new level of simplicity and provides access to 28 aggregators, ensuring you always have access to the best liquidity and rates for your swaps.

- But here’s the best part: One of the unique benefits of using Xenify is that you earn veXNF every time you pay the 0.5% swap fee on chains where XNF is deployed. This means that you not only enjoy seamless token swaps but also accumulate XNF, the native token of Xenify.

- And the rewards keep coming! Holding veXNF entitles you to additional daily rewards such as BNB, ETH, and MATIC, based on the burn fees and swap fees generated during each cycle. Xenify is not just simplifying the swap process; it’s transforming it. We not only offer you the ultimate efficiency and market-leading rates, but a truly rewarding swap experience.

![Grey V4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60996729/235287926-6b18081e-ca41-48c7-8dfc-29cc32c598f1.png)

## ✨ Fair Equity Distribution

- Xenify is dedicated to promoting fairness and transparency in the distribution of equity among its users. Our unique tokenomics and staking model are designed to reward active participants and long-term holders, creating a strong incentive for users to contribute to the growth of our ecosystem. As our community continues to grow, the equitable distribution of rewards and XNF tokens ensures that everyone benefits, promoting a vibrant and engaged community. Xenify's commitment to fairness and equity fosters trust within the ecosystem, promoting a sustainable and inclusive environment for all participants.

# ◽️ XEN Overview 
![Line Divider - Filled](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60996729/233879462-b465c484-4c2f-4cd2-a126-19529e333d64.png)

XEN is a project that was launched on the principles of self-custody, trustless consensus, and decentralisation. It is a joint effort of several blockchain enthusiasts who aim to create a fairer, more transparent mining ecosystem. One of the main goals of XEN is to democratise mining by providing a decentralised platform that allows anyone to participate in the mining process. This is achieved by utilising a Proof-of-Work (PoW) consensus algorithm that is resistant to ASIC mining, thus ensuring that the network remains accessible to individual miners.

In addition to its mining capabilities, XEN also features a native cryptocurrency, XEN token, which is used to incentivise miners and maintain the security of the network. XEN tokens are also used to pay for transaction fees and other network services. XEN operates on a Proof of Participation (PoP) system, which allows participants to mint their coins. The XEN smart contract employs a fair distribution system based on reward time locks and the total number of participants. XEN's value is linked to its difficulty to be minted, similar to Bitcoin. As more participants join and mint XEN, the total amount of generated XEN drops, making it more scarce and valuable. One of the key features of XEN is its simplicity, as it is based on the ERC20 token standard with minimal code, no pre-minting, hidden doors, admin keys, or origin wallets. Furthermore, XEN has a supply of zero and can only be minted by the participating community. This makes it inflationary at the beginning and disinflationary as adoption increases. XEN is immutable and has no backing by investors or intrinsic value.

To mint XEN, participants can connect their Ethereum-compatible wallets to the XEN smart contract and specify the number of days they are willing to wait to receive XEN. The smart contract generates a XEN rank (cRANK) based on how many people interacted with the contract before the participant. Participants can also stake XEN for 1 to 1000 days, with APY rewards starting at 20% on XEN Genesis and decreasing by 1 percentage point every 90 days until it reaches 2%, where it will remain indefinitely. Overall, XEN represents an innovative approach to mining that emphasises decentralisation, accessibility, and sustainability. XEN's combination of features, simplicity and fairness make it a unique and promising project in the crypto space.

# ◽️ XNF & veXNF Overview
![Line Divider - Filled](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60996729/233879462-b465c484-4c2f-4cd2-a126-19529e333d64.png)

At the heart of Xenify lies XNF, a dynamic reward token designed to encourage active participation from users. Its distinctive tokenomics forms the foundation for a unique approach to claiming and locking, fostering greater user engagement and providing users with control over their earning strategies. This means you have the freedom to claim your XNF rewards and decide on a lock period tailored to your preferences, spanning anywhere from a short 1 week to a maximum of 1 year. This level of customisation offers a truly personalised interaction with the protocol. When you lock your XNF tokens, a unique ERC-721 non-fungible token (NFT) is minted in exchange - known as veXNF. Beyond merely reflecting your stake within the protocol, veXNF also acts as an indicator of your 'earning power', influencing your portion of the native rewards distribution.

The power of your veXNF aligns with the amount of XNF you've locked and the duration of your chosen lock-in period. It's important to note that this 'earning power' isn't static. Over time, even if you opt for the maximum 1 year lock-in period, the strength of your veXNF power gradually diminishes. This decline underscores the importance of regularly engaging with the protocol to maintain and even enhance your earning potential. To boost your veXNF power and ensure a consistent capacity to earn, it's advised to not only claim rewards but also add to your locked XNF balance, and extend your lock duration as needed. For users aiming to sustain their earning potential over time, the protocol offers an opportunity to extend lock periods. By doing so, you not only increase your veXNF power but also reset the decay schedule of your position, fostering continued involvement in the protocol.

Beyond extending lock periods, users can also take advantage of the option to merge or split their veXNF positions. When merging multiple veXNF NFTs, the protocol consolidates locked balances and issues a fresh veXNF NFT with the longest lock period among the merged tokens. Alternatively, when opting to split your veXNF position, the old NFT is burned, and new veXNF NFTs are minted based on the specified percentages you've chosen. In essence, XNF and veXNF work hand in hand to not only reward your engagement but also empower you to tailor your involvement in the Xenify Protocol to your unique preferences and goals.

Introducing Xenify, the ultimate cross-chain aggregator of aggregators! Expertly designed to streamline the swapping process for users traversing multiple chains, Xenify offers unmatched capabilities. Powered by an advanced liquidity aggregation protocol, Xenify connects to 28 different aggregators, delivering exceptional liquidity and unbeatable rates across 52 leading chains. Whether you want to swap tokens between Ethereum, BNB Chain, Polygon, or many others, Xenify makes it effortless and rewarding!

Imagine this scenario: you want to trade Token-A on Ethereum for Token-B on BNB Chain. With Xenify, all it takes is a single click and a single transaction on Ethereum. No more hassle of navigating different chains or searching for the best rates – Xenify takes care of everything, providing you with the most favourable rates available. But there's more to Xenify than just token swaps; It's a meticulously designed ecosystem with unique tokenomics, incorporating a groundbreaking incentive model that benefits all participants. 

Xenify's built-in swap fee mechanism creates a reciprocal environment that rewards platform users with XNF, and veXNF holders with swap fees generated across supported chains. On chains where XNF has yet to be deployed, the swap fee is utilised by the team to promote and enhance the Xenify platform and its associated tokens, ensuring widespread awareness and adoption.

Here's how it works: When you opt to pay the 0.5% swap fee to execute a swap on supported EVM chains where XNF has been deployed, you not only facilitate your transaction but also secure a position in the daily XNF distribution for that chain. At the end of each day, 50% of your swap fee is utilised for the Partner Fee Sharing Programme, and the remaining 50% distributed as native rewards to veXNF holders on that specific chain. This means you not only earn XNF tokens based on your swap fee contribution but also reward veXNF holders with native chain tokens, while simultaneously supporting the expansion of Xenify. It's a win-win situation for everyone involved.

What's more, Xenify incorporates an ingenious burn mechanism that enables users to burn XEN and YSL tokens to mint XNF. The XEN burning process acts as a strategic layer 1 burner, and here's the exciting part – 50% of the burn fees go back to veXNF holders, while 50% is utilised to create XNF protocol-owned liquidity. This approach not only encourages long-term user engagement but also improves sustainability, while enhancing rewards for those deeply involved with the protocol.

Xenify's innovative approach to staking and rewards, combined with its unique tokenomics model, creates a thoughtfully designed ecosystem that benefits all participants. Whether you're executing token swaps or burning tokens to mint XNF, every action you take on the Xenify platform contributes to a reciprocal environment of rewards and engagement. You not only enjoy unparalleled efficiency when swapping across 52 leading chains but also have the opportunity to earn native chain tokens daily and be part of a thriving community. Xenify truly offers the best of both worlds: effortless token swaps and significant earning potential.

## ⭐️ Token Supply

XNF is the lifeblood of the Xenify protocol, and features a limited total supply of 22.6 million tokens. The distribution process for XNF is designed with transparency and equity in mind, ensuring a level playing field for all. With no pre-mines, investor allocations, founder allocations, or team allocations, the Xenify protocol fosters an environment of fairness and inclusivity. Users have the opportunity to earn XNF equity by engaging in various activities, such as burning XEN or YSL tokens and swapping tokens from supported chains. This unique token supply model not only promotes active participation but also cultivates a thriving, community-focused ecosystem that everyone can be a part of.

## ⭐️ Supply Distribution

With a total supply capped at 22.6 million XNF tokens, strategically divided into three core segments, Xenify has been purposefully designed to reward active participants while promoting a balanced ecosystem:

- **21,000,000 XNF assigned for the daily auctions:** Users who participate in various activities that bolster the ongoing development of the protocol will have the chance to earn a share of the XNF tokens dedicated to the daily auctions. In each cycle, should there be no XEN or YSL burners, the XNF allocation initially designated for the burn auction will be distributed among swap participants, and vice versa.

  - 10,500,000 XNF (50%) is distributed to burn auction participants. This allocation will be distributed equally, with 50% set aside for XEN burners and the remaining 50% for YSL burners. In the event that there are no YSL burners during a cycle, the entire daily XNF allocation designated for the burn auction will be distributed among XEN burners, and vice versa.

  - 10,500,000 XNF (50%) is distributed to users who engage in swaps on supported EVM chains. These XNF tokens will be distributed among swap participants in the form of veXNF, with an associated lock period of 1 year.

- **100,000 XNF assigned for XNF liquidity creation:** To facilitate this, we have set aside 100,000 XNF for the protocol’s Burn Auction. Each time a user participates in the daily burn of XEN or YSL they will be contributing to the proliferation of XNF liquidity. This initiative bolsters the overall health of the protocol and fosters a robust liquidity pool for our community.

- **1,500,000 XNF assigned as an exclusive airdrop for swap participants:** To encourage engagement, each chain will have an exclusive airdrop of 1,500,000 XNF for users that perform swaps before the deployment of XNF. The airdrop will take place on the first day of launch, and will be distributed as locked tokens, gradually unlocking over 730 days.

Drawing inspiration from Bitcoin, Xenify's distribution model adopts the halving principle. As illustrated in the accompanying graph below, following the 7th halving, the rate of Xenify's daily mint allocation stabilises, ensuring a consistent output of 156.25 XNF tokens per day until the maximum supply is reached in month 2461. This innovative strategy has been thoughtfully engineered to ensure an equitable supply distribution centred around long-term user participation, highlighting Xenify's unwavering commitment to fostering a balanced ecosystem and an engaged community.

## ⭐️ XNF Minting Process and Incentives

The XNF minting process within Xenify has been meticulously structured to reward users who actively engage with and contribute to the protocol's growth. This initiative ensures an equitable distribution of XNF tokens and fosters a genuinely decentralised and community-driven protocol. Xenify's incentive model is carefully crafted, offering proportionate rewards to users who intensify their engagement with the platform. Such an approach propels further participation, as users stand to acquire newly minted XNF tokens relative to their platform activity.

Distribution of XNF tokens follows one-day cycles, initiating with a reward pool of 20,000 XNF tokens. This daily allocation gets split evenly: 50% is distributed to users who burn XEN or YSL tokens, with the remaining 50% reserved for contributors to the platform's swap fee. This daily allocation will extend across all other future deployment chains as well. Through the implementation of a halving model, the daily minting quantity gradually reduces, culminating in the complete distribution of the total 22.6 million XNF tokens by month 2461.

Users are further incentivised through the platform's staking mechanism, which allows them to accumulate rewards in the form of chain-specific native tokens, such as ETH on the Ethereum chain. These rewards are generated from various activities within Xenify, specifically from swap fees and burn fees. Our unique three-tiered incentive model prompts users to use Xenify to earn XNF, while also rewarding those who lock their XNF tokens to earn native rewards. This operates as a flywheel, propelling Xenify's long-term growth while cultivating a vibrant and sustainable reward system that incentivises an ever-growing user base.

![Grey V4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60996729/235287926-6b18081e-ca41-48c7-8dfc-29cc32c598f1.png)

## ✨ Burn to Earn XNF 

Xenify empowers users to effortlessly burn their XEN or YSL tokens directly from their wallets to participate in the daily burn cycle. This burn mechanism goes beyond simply reducing the circulating supply of XEN tokens and YSL.IO native tokens; it embodies a strategic approach that brings together the YSL.IO community and the broader XEN communities across all chains, fostering a shared vision that unifies both ecosystems.

To acquire XNF with XEN, you'll need to burn the XEN token variant supported by the chain you're on, such as bXEN on the BNB Chain. This burn function positions our protocol as a key player in the strategic layer 1 burning of XEN tokens. Each time you burn your native XEN token variant, your address will be logged in the X1 burn record, and in return, you'll receive XNF. It's essential to note that this burn incurs a Burn Fee. Please be aware that the quantity of XEN required to obtain one batch will be fixed and vary depending on the chain you choose to burn. For instance, to participate in Xenify's burn auction on the BNB Chain, a minimum holding of 1,000,000,000 bXEN is required (as one batch on the BNB Chain equals 1,000,000,000 bXEN).

Similarly, holders of YSL tokens can actively participate in our daily burn auction. Just like the XEN burning process, executing the burn of your YSL tokens will necessitate a Burn Fee. During this process, the YSL tokens you provide are permanently removed from circulation, and the Burn Fee is employed to create XNF protocol-owned liquidity and reward veXNF holders. In line with XEN, please note that the conversion rate for YSL during the burn process will be fixed, with 0.1 YSL equivalent to one batch.

Whether you opt to burn XEN or YSL, the value of the batches (VB) being burned will be contingent on the specific chain you select for the burn. For example, the batch value on the BNB Chain will be fixed at 0.1 BNB, while on Ethereum, it will be 0.01 ETH. This value will be utilised by the protocol to determine the Burn Fee (BF) required to execute the burn function, ensuring a seamless and transparent process for all participants. 

During the burn process, the XEN or YSL tokens you provide are burned (permanently removed from circulation), and 50% of your Burn Fee is utilised to reward veXNF holders and 50% to create protocol-owned liquidity for XNF. If the 100,000 Preminted XNF is available, 50% of your burn fee will be paired with preminted XNF for liquidity pairing. However, if the preminted XNF allocation has been depleted, the protocol will use 25% of your Burn Fee to purchase XNF tokens and the remaining 25% for the liquidity pairing with the LP tokens being held by the protocol.

## ✨ Swap to Earn XNF 

Xenify is redefining the game with a groundbreaking platform that enables seamless single-click cross-chain transactions across 52 chains, while providing users the exciting opportunity to earn native chain tokens daily. Every time users pay the 0.5% swap fee on chains where XNF has been deployed, they are rewarded with veXNF through daily mint allocation. This unique advantage enables users to enjoy an effortless swapping experience while simultaneously accumulating XNF tokens.

But, the rewards don't stop there. By holding veXNF, users have the opportunity to rake in native chain tokens like BNB, ETH, and MATIC on a daily basis. These native rewards stem from the protocol’s swap fees and burn fees.  As a result, users can not only enjoy the efficiency and competitive rates Xenify offers but also gain access to a dynamic and sustainable reward system that enhances their portfolio.

By participating in token swaps with Xenify, users play a pivotal role in driving the platform's growth. The swap fees generated on chains where XNF has been deployed are distributed among the veXNF holders on that specific chain and utilised for Xenify’s Partner Fee Sharing Programme. For chains where XNF is yet to be deployed, the swap fees are utilised by the team to support promotional efforts and advance the development of Xenify and its affiliated tokens. This fosters greater awareness and wider adoption of the platform, benefiting the entire community.

Moreover, by engaging in swaps on any of the 52 supported chains, users become eligible for an exclusive airdrop of 1,500,000 XNF. Each airdrop event takes place on a chain where XNF is scheduled to be deployed and lasts for 60 days before the launch. All swaps conducted during this period guarantee users a share of the upcoming XNF airdrop. In other words, even though you don’t benefit from a daily XNF allocation when you execute swaps on chains where XNF hasn’t been deployed, you still have the opportunity to be included in an exclusive XNF airdrop.

## ✨ Lock XNF to Earn Native Rewards

Distinguishing itself from generic aggregators, Xenify takes pride in its avant-garde incentive model that empowers platform users to execute seamless swaps and embark on a rewarding journey by earning rewards every cycle based on their locked XNF. These rewards are distributed in the form of native chain tokens — a highly liquid asset — signaling a potentially lucrative return for users who lock XNF.

veXNF holders play an essential role in Xenify's long-term growth, and in return reap the benefits. For chains where XNF has been deployed, veXNF holders enjoy native tokens generated from swap fees across all supported EVM chains at the end of each cycle. As Xenify continues to broaden its reach, an increasing amount of swap volume is guaranteed, with users eager to benefit from a seamless swapping experience while earning XNF on every swap they make. Consequently, veXNF holders benefit from increased rewards! This equitable model establishes a virtuous cycle, guaranteeing every participant benefits in direct proportion to their engagement.

In addition to swap fees, veXNF holders on chains where XNF has been deployed, will also earn native tokens at the end of each cycle generated from the burn fee. With XNF adopting the halving model and 50% of the daily mint reserved for those burning XEN or YSL, participating in the daily burn auction is one of the few means to securing a sizable XNF position. As more users burn XEN and YSL to acquire XNF, not only do veXNF holders profit from increased rewards through the burn fee, but the ecosystem benefits through increased proliferation of XNF liquidity. This innovative burn cycle implementation creates another positive feedback loop, ensuring the entire ecosystem thrives through active user participation.

Xenify's innovative staking model enables users to lock their XNF tokens for an opportunity to receive a steady stream of exceptional rewards in the form of native rewards. This distinctive rewards distribution model not only strengthens demand and value for XNF, but also serves as an added incentive for holders to lock their daily XNF distributions. This strategy has been integrated to encourage long-term engagement with the protocol, while cultivating an ever-expanding user base.

## ⭐️ Costs of Swapping on Xenify

Xenify offers a groundbreaking token swap solution that not only simplifies cross-chain transactions but also rewards its users, all the while nurturing the expansion of its ecosystem. Through a 0.5% fee on every token swap, Xenify is able to achieve three crucial objectives: reward its platform users with XNF tokens, provide native rewards to veXNF holders, and ensure the continuous development of the protocol.

Here's how it works: When a user initiates a token swap on Xenify, they can choose to pay an optional 0.5% swap fee. This fee is strategically allocated to encourage future growth and incentivise user engagement. On chains where XNF has been deployed, 50% of the swap fee will be utilised for the proliferation of XNF liquidity, and the remaining 50% will be distributed as rewards among veXNF holders in the form of native chain tokens. 

By paying the nominal 0.5% swap fee on chains where XNF is deployed, you not only expedite your transaction but also secure an allocation of XNF from the protocol's daily mint cycle. These XNF tokens are locked for 1 year and distributed among swap participants as veXNF. This unique ERC-721 non-fungible token (NFT) will represent your XNF holdings, which can be withdrawn at the end of the lockup period. 

And here's the exciting part, by holding veXNF you unlock additional gains in the form of native rewards based on your earning power. These rewards are distributed at the close of each daily cycle. In essence, by simply executing a swap on Xenify, you have the incredible opportunity to rake in native chain tokens such as BNB and ETH on a daily basis!

But that’s not all! The swap fee has also been designed to support the expansion of Xenify through our innovative Fee Sharing Programme. This initiative provides an exciting opportunity for partner projects to earn a share of the swap fees generated on their native tokens. This way, we can encourage more projects to join our ecosystem and empower their users to reap the benefits of Xenify. With 25% of the swap fee shared equally between the partner project and Xenify, we establish a mutually advantageous relationship that supports the partner project and bolsters Xenify's ongoing development, marketing, and outreach efforts.

In short, the Xenify Fee Sharing Programme strategically leverages the swap fee to align incentives between swap participants, veXNF holders, partners, and the protocol itself - facilitating sustainable growth for all.

## ⭐️ Costs of Burning on Xenify

The Xenify protocol enables users to burn XEN or YSL tokens to secure XNF from the daily XNF reward cycle. By participating in the burn process to acquire XNF, users will encounter certain costs such as transaction gas fees and the mandatory burn fee. However, the burn fee calculation has been carefully designed to not only ensure a transparent and consistent method for token burning but also reward users with an attractive discount of up to 75%.

The burn fee formula is designed to consider various factors, including the timing of the burn during a cycle, the number of batches being burned, and their associated value. The best part? The more batches a user burns, the greater the discount they'll enjoy, with potential savings of up to 75% off for 10,000 batches during the first hour of every cycle. This creates an attractive incentive for users to undertake larger burn operations at earlier points in a cycle.

By implementing this formula, we ensure that users receive discounts in proportion to the volume of a specific token (XEN or YSL) they burn. Furthermore, we are proud to emphasise that 100% of the burn fees collected are redeployed as rewards to veXNF holders and utilised to bolster XNF liquidity. This approach not only encourages efficiency but also rewards our valuable contributors, while establishing a mutually beneficial ecosystem that ensures the continual proliferation of liquidity. Plus, with the maximum discount of 75% for 10,000 batches, the more users burn, the more they save! This exciting prospect not only offers substantial benefits for those who burn but also generates enhanced rewards for veXNF holders.

But what exactly is a batch? A batch represents a fixed number of tokens, either XEN or YSL, required to participate in the burn process. A single batch for XEN is set at a fixed amount and will vary depending on the XEN variant being burned. For instance, a single batch of bXEN on the BNB Chain has been set at 1,000,000,000 bXEN. Similarly, a single batch for YSL is set at a fixed amount of 0.1 YSL. 

The value per batch for a chain is established when Xenify is deployed, and will be dynamically based on the current price of the chain’s native token using the formula below:

<br>

$$
VP = 10 ^ {2 - ND}
$$

<br>

**Where:**

- $VP$ (Value Per Batch) - The value per batch that is set for the chain.
- $ND$ (Number of Digits) - The count of digits preceding the decimal point in the price of the native gas token.

Here’s how it works: The value per batch is calculated as 10 raised to the power of (2 - ND), where ND is the number of digits before the decimal place in the native token's price. This formula creates a batch value that remains consistent relative to the native token's price. When the native token value is high, the value per batch set at deployment will be proportionally lower to ensure an appropriate burn fee for the chain. 

This mechanism helps ensure that the burn fee remains consistent across different chains where Xenify deploys, particularly for chains with higher-priced native tokens. For instance, the value of one batch on BNB Chain will be set at 0.1 BNB at deployment, since BNB has 3 digits before the decimal point at its current market value. However, when Xenify deploys on Ethereum, the value of one batch will be set at 0.01 ETH, since ETH has 4 digits before the decimal point at its current value above $1000. 

By aligning batch values to native token prices and providing volume discounts, our burn fee formula enables transparency while encouraging burning. Moreover, 100% of the tokens you provide will be burned - this ensures your wallet address is included in the burn record for the distribution of X1 - the native token of the new XEN Layer 1 (X1 Chain).

![Grey V4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60996729/235287926-6b18081e-ca41-48c7-8dfc-29cc32c598f1.png)

## ⭐️ Time-Weighted Burn Fee Discount

Xenify introduces an innovative approach to burn fee discounts that aims to promote fairness and prevent manipulation. By implementing a carefully designed burn fee calculation, the protocol effectively curbs unfair practices where users strategically time transactions to maximise their rewards or incentives.

The Burn Fee (BF) calculation includes time-weighted factors known as the Time Coefficient (FC) and the Batch Coefficient (BC), which help determine the fee needed to execute the burn function based on the value of batches being burned. The burn fee discount that you obtain will be dependent on the Time Coefficient (FC) and the Batch Coefficient (BC) that is applicable when you are burning during a cycle. Both coefficients are time-weighted, decreasing throughout the daily cycle. This means the effective discount that you obtain will vary depending on when you decide to burn during a cycle.

To initiate the burn function on Xenify, users must have a sufficient wallet balance of native chain tokens that meets or exceeds the amount required for the Burn Fee. The protocol will calculate the Burn Fee (BF) using the formula below:

<br>

$$
BF = (FC \times VB) \times (1 - (NB \times BC))
$$

<br>

**Where:**

- $BF$ (Burn Fee) - The fee charged for the burn function, paid in the native token of the blockchain.
- $FC$ (Time Coefficient) - A time-weighted coefficient used to factor in a discount based on when the burn is being executed during a cycle.
- $VB$ (Value of Batches) - The value of batches being burned by the user. The value per batch will be fixed and vary depending on the chain. 
- $BC$ (Batch Coefficient) - A time-weighted coefficient used to factor in the discount based on the batches being burned.
- $NB$ (Number of Batches) - The number of batches the user burns, influencing the discount in burn fees as the number of batches increases. This will be capped at 10,000 batches.

<br>

It's worth noting that the burn fee discount you receive will depend on the current values of the Time Coefficient (FC) and the Batch Coefficient (BC) at the time of burning. As these coefficients decrease throughout the daily cycle, the effective discount you obtain will vary depending on when you decide to burn during a cycle. This dynamic approach ensures that users have an opportunity to benefit from different discount levels based on their timing.

Xenify's approach to burn fee discounts not only promotes fairness but also provides users with the potential to optimise their savings. By considering the time-weighted coefficients and strategically choosing when to execute burns, users can maximise their discounts and overall value. This innovative approach brings transparency, fairness, and increased benefits to all participants of the Xenify ecosystem.

![Grey V4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60996729/235287926-6b18081e-ca41-48c7-8dfc-29cc32c598f1.png)

## ⭐️ Time Coefficient (FC)

The Burn Fee (BF) needed to execute the burn function will increase as the total value of batches being burned increases, however by executing burns earlier in the cycle users have the opportunity to benefit from a lower burn fee thanks to the Time Coefficient (FC). 

As illustrated in the table below, the Time Coefficient starts at 50% when a cycle begins and increases by approximately 2.174% every hour until it reaches 100% in the final hour of the daily cycle. This means that users will need to contribute more to execute the burn function as the day goes on. However, it also provides an opportunity for users who burn earlier in the cycle to get a discount of up to 75% during the first hour of each cycle. 

<br>

| Hour | Time Coefficient (FC)     |
|------|---------------------------|
| 1    | 50.00%                    |
| 2    | 52.17%                    |
| 3    | 54.35%                    |
| 4    | 56.52%                    |
| 5    | 58.70%                    |

| 23   | 97.83%                    |
| 24   | 100.00%                   |

![Grey V4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60996729/235287926-6b18081e-ca41-48c7-8dfc-29cc32c598f1.png)

## ⭐️ Batch Coefficient (BC)

The Batch Coefficient (BC) factors in a discount on the burn fee based on the number of batches you burn. The more batches you burn, the greater the batch discount, represented by the term (1 - (NB x BC)). The value of the Batch Coefficient (BC) varies depending on when a user decides to burn during a cycle. 

The table below illustrates how the value of the coefficient changes during a 24-hour cycle. The constant starts at 0.00005 when the cycle begins and decreases by 0.0000025 every hour until it reaches zero after 20 hours. As a result, users will not benefit from the batch discount during the last four hours of the cycle.

<br>

| Hour | Batch Coefficient (BC)    |
|------|---------------------------|
| 1    | 0.00005                   |
| 2    | 0.0000475                 |

## ⭐️ Different Burn Fee Scenarios

Let's take a closer look at how the Time-Weighted Burn Fee Discount operates in different scenarios:

![Grey V4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60996729/235287926-6b18081e-ca41-48c7-8dfc-29cc32c598f1.png)

## ⚡️ Scenario 1: User burns during Hour-1 of a cycle

Let’s say you decide to burn 10,000 batches during the first hour of the daily cycle on BNB Chain, where the value per batch is set at 0.1 BNB. Taking into account that the Batch Coefficient (BC) during the first hour of a cycle is 0.00005 and the Time Coefficient (FC) during the first hour is 50%, the protocol will determine your Burn Fee (BF) as 250 BNB.

<br>

$$
BF = (0.5 \times 1000) \times (1 - (10,000 \times 0.00005)) = 250 \space BNB
$$

<br>

![Grey V4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60996729/235287926-6b18081e-ca41-48c7-8dfc-29cc32c598f1.png)

## ⚡️ Scenario 2: User burns during Hour-24 of a cycle

Now, let’s say you decide to burn 10,000 batches during the last hour of the daily cycle on BNB Chain, where the value per batch is set at 0.1 BNB. Taking into account that the Batch Coefficient (BC) during the last hour of a cycle is 0 and the Time Coefficient (FC) during the last hour is 100%, the protocol will determine your Burn Fee (BF) as 1000 BNB.

<br>

$$
BF = (1 \times 1000) \times (1 - (10,000 \times 0)) = 1000 \space BNB
$$

<br>

Comparing these scenarios highlights the benefits of burning batches in the first hour versus the final hour. The maximum savings of 75% are only possible if you burn 10,000 batches during the first hour of the daily cycle. This time-weighted burn fee mechanism mitigates unfair practices and enhances fairness, rewarding users who execute larger burns earlier in the cycle with greater discounts.

![Grey V4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60996729/235287926-6b18081e-ca41-48c7-8dfc-29cc32c598f1.png)

## ⭐️ XNF Cycle Distribution

Xenify employs a balanced approach in the daily distribution of XNF tokens, with a focus on two central components across all the chains it's deployed on: burn fees and swap fees. These components receive an equal share of the daily mint, with 50% allocated to users who participate in burning XEN or YSL tokens, and the remaining 50% distributed among those who engage in swaps.

For instance, if the daily minted amount of XNF tokens is 20,000, the distribution is split evenly. Those contributing to burn fees receive 10,000 XNF tokens, and an equivalent amount is given to those contributing to swap fees. This uniform allocation structure extends to all chains where Xenify is present. Thus, irrespective of the chain they're using, participants involved in either burning tokens or executing swaps have the opportunity to earn a portion of the daily minted XNF tokens.

For example, if the daily XNF mint is 20,000 XNF tokens, Xenify will distribute the allocation two ways: 10,000 XNF is given to those contributing to burn fees, and 10,000 XNF to those contributing to swap fees. This same allocation structure is applied across all other chains where Xenify is deployed. Consequently, regardless of the chain, users contributing to the burning of tokens or engaging in swaps will have an opportunity to earn a portion of the newly minted XNF tokens each day.

To ascertain each user's share of the daily mint allocated to burn and swap contributions, the protocol will perform a series of calculations. These calculations will be based on the swap and burn contributions made by a user during the cycle. The protocol will consolidate these contributions to accurately compute the total XNF distribution for each user. This methodical approach ensures an equitable distribution, crediting both the user's active engagement in token burns and their contribution in terms of swap fees. The protocol calculates your share of the daily XNF allocated to burn fee contributions (BC), by taking into account the total XNF tokens distributed (TD), the total number of batches burned by all users during the cycle (TB), and the number of batches you burned during the cycle (UB). Here's the formula explained in detail:

<br>

$$
BA = (TD \div 2) \times (UB \div TB)
$$

<br>

**Where:**

- $BA$ (Burn Allocation) - The amount of XNF a specific user obtains based on the batches burned during a cycle.
- $TD$ (Total XNF Distributed) - The total number of XNF tokens that are distributed among users during a specific cycle.
- $UB$ (Batches Burned by User) - The number of batches burned during a cycle by the specific user whose burn contribution is being calculated.
- $TB$ (Total Batches Burned) - The combined number of batches burned by all users during a cycle.

<br>

Here’s how it works: The protocol calculates the user’s burn allocation by first dividing the total XNF tokens scheduled to be distributed for the cycle (TD) by 2, as 50% of the XNF daily mint is allocated to participants that burn XEN or YSL. It then calculates the proportion of batches burned by the specific user (UB) to the total batches burned by all users (TB). This results in a value per batch burned. Finally, the protocol multiplies these values to determine the user’s individual burn allocation for that cycle (BA).

The calculation of the swap contribution follows a similar logic, whereby the protocol calculates your swap allocation (SA) for a cycle, by taking into account the total XNF tokens scheduled to be distributed for the cycle (TD), the total swap fees paid by all users during the cycle (TS), and the swap fees paid by you during the cycle (US). Here's the formula explained in detail:

<br>

$$
SA = (TD \div 2) \times (US \div TS)
$$

<br>

**Where:**

- $SA$ (Swap Allocation) - The XNF allocation for a specific user based on their swap fee contributions during a cycle.
- $TD$ (Total XNF Distributed) - The total number of XNF tokens that are distributed among users during a specific cycle.
- $US$ (User Swap Fees) - The swap fees paid by a specific user in a cycle.
- $TS$ (Total Swap Fees) - The total swap fees paid in a cycle by all users.

<br>

Here’s how it works: The protocol calculates the user's swap contribution (SC) by first dividing the total XNF tokens distributed (TD) by 2, as 50% of the XNF daily mint is allocated to participants that perform swaps on supported chains. It then multiplies the result by the ratio of the user's swap fees (US) to the total swap fees (TS) paid by all users. This generates a specific value for each unit of swap fee paid and helps in determining the proportion of XNF tokens a user receives based on their individual contribution to the swap fees in a given cycle.

## ⭐️ Locking XNF Tokens

Each cycle, Xenify's protocol distributes newly minted XNF tokens to its users. The distribution takes place at the end of each day and adheres to a particular allocation structure. Specifically, 50% of the daily minted XNF is allotted to users who engage in the burning of XEN and YSL tokens, and the remaining 50% is distributed as veXNF to users who participate in swaps across all supported EVM chains.

Locked XNF tokens play an essential role in the accumulation of native rewards for users, with each user's share being determined by their veXNF position and the associated earning power. Your XNF tokens start to accumulate native rewards within the same cycle they are locked. These rewards are gathered into a reward pool during each cycle and then distributed among veXNF holders by the protocol at the end of the daily cycle. Users that earn XNF through their swap fee contributions will not be required to lock their XNF, as the protocol automatically locks their XNF allocation for the maximum lock-in period of 1 year and enables the user to earn native rewards over a 60-day decay schedule. 

On the other hand, users who earn XNF through burn fee contributions and recycling will need to manually lock their XNF tokens if they are aiming to earn a share of native rewards. In doing so, they lock their XNF for a chosen staking period, which can be as short as one week or as long as one year. Once the desired lock period has been set, the user's XNF is locked as per the selected period. Subsequently, the protocol mints a veXNF NFT for the user, reflecting the amount of XNF locked and the chosen lock period. Throughout the lock period, users cannot unlock their XNF but continue to accumulate native rewards based on the earning power of their veXNF.

A user's earning power will decrease linearly over a decay schedule. This decay schedule will be dependent on the user's chosen lock period, and will be set to a maximum of 60 days for a 1 year lock period. This enables the protocol to scale the decay schedule linearly between a minimum of 1.15 days (for a 7-day lock) and a maximum of 60 days (for a 365-day lock) based on the lock duration that the user chose. The longer the lock, the longer the decay schedule, ranging from 1.16 to 60 days. The decay schedule for a users veXNF earning power will be determined by the protocol using the formula below:

<br>

$$
DS = (LD \div ML) \times MD
$$

<br>

**Where:**

- $DS$ (Decay Schedule) - The decay schedule for the veXNF earning power.
- $MD$ (Maximum Decay Schedule) - The maximum decay schedule of 60 days.
- $LD$ (Lock Duration) - The user’s chosen lock duration in days.
- $ML$ (Maximum Lock) - The maximum lock duration of 365 days.

<br>

The longer you lock your XNF, the greater your veXNF earning power. However, it's important to note this earning power decays over time, even if you opt for the maximum 1-year lock period. This decay mechanic incentivises users to lock for longer terms to maintain higher earning strength for longer. Your earning potential directly correlates to the amount of XNF you lock and your chosen lock duration. At the start of your lock period, your veXNF is minted with 100% earning power. Over time, as your lock continues, the strength of this earning power diminishes based on the custom decay formula below:

<br>

$$
CP = IP \times ((1 - TE \div LD) \times (LD \div ML))
$$

<br>

**Where:**

- $CP$ (Current veXNF Power) - The users' current earning power in percentage terms.
- $IP$ (Initial veXNF Power) - An initial earning power of 100% is set by the protocol at the start of the lock period.
- $TE$ (Time Elapsed) - The time that has elapsed since the lock period commenced.
- $LD$ (Lock Duration) - The lock duration chosen by the user (days).
- $ML$ (Maximum Lock) - The maximum lock duration of 365 days.

## ⭐️ Different Earning Power Scenarios

Let's take a closer look at how the Earning Power Decay operates in different scenarios:

![Grey V4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60996729/235287926-6b18081e-ca41-48c7-8dfc-29cc32c598f1.png)

## ⚡️ Scenario 1: User locks XNF for 1 week

Let’s say you decide to lock your XNF for the minimum term of 1 week. After 1 day your Earning power would have decayed from 100% to 16.3%.

<br>

$$
CP = 100 \times ((1 - 1 \div 7) \times (7 \div 365)) = 16.3
$$

<br>

## ⚡️ Scenario 2: User locks XNF for 1 year 

Let’s say you decide to lock your XNF for the maximum term of 1 year. After 1 day your Earning power would have decayed from 100% to 99.7%.

<br>

$$
CP = 100 \times ((1 - 1 \div 365) \times (365 \div 365)) = 99.7
$$

<br>

Comparing these scenarios highlights the benefits of locking for longer periods. After just 1 day of a 1-year lock, your earning power would barely decay by 0.3% to 99.7%. On the other hand, if you lock your XNF tokens for one week, your earning power decays much faster. After just one day, your earning power would drop by 83.7% to 16.3%. This demonstrates how locking for longer periods preserves your earning power for longer. 

This model rewards long-term participants and aligns incentives toward supporting the protocol. To maintain or increase your earning power, you can always add more XNF tokens to your veXNF position or extend your lock duration as needed. Keep in mind, that the amount of rewards you receive at the end of each cycle depends on your share of the total earning power of all veXNF holders. The more XNF you have locked and the higher your earning power, the more rewards you earn.

![Grey V4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60996729/235287926-6b18081e-ca41-48c7-8dfc-29cc32c598f1.png)

## ⭐️ Unlocking XNF Tokens

At Xenify, we empower our users with flexibility when managing their veXNF position with the ability to extend, merge and even split positions. After completing your chosen lock period, you will have the option to unlock your XNF tokens. Importantly, unstaking is only possible after your lock period ends - your XNF remains locked for the duration you selected. Throughout your staking cycle, you accumulate native rewards based on the amount of XNF locked and your veXNF earning power. This earning power decays linearly over a decay schedule until it reaches zero at the end. At this point, you stop earning rewards on your locked position as your veXNF earning power is depleted.

You now have two options: Either extend your lock period (from 1 week up to 1 year) to reinstate your veXNF earning power and continue receiving rewards. Or, wait for your current lock to expire, then unlock to regain your XNF tokens. The decision depends on your circumstances and preferences. If you extend your lock, your veXNF is reactivated at 100% strength, starting a new decay schedule. This allows you to continue benefiting from rewards linked to your locked XNF. Alternatively, waiting for your lock expiry, enables you to unlock and/or sell your tokens. However, you will not be earning rewards in the interim.

![Grey V4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60996729/235287926-6b18081e-ca41-48c7-8dfc-29cc32c598f1.png)

## ⭐️ Claiming Native Rewards

At Xenify, you can conveniently withdraw your accumulated native rewards at any time. However, be aware that directly claiming rewards incurs a 25% claim fee. To avoid this fee, simply click "Recycle" instead of "Claim". Recycling leverages your accrued rewards to acquire XNF through the daily burn auction, while bypassing the mandatory burn fee.

When you opt to claim your rewards, the native tokens gathered from the claim fee are stored in a temporary pool. At the end of the cycle, these tokens are distributed exclusively to veXNF holders who recycled their rewards within the first hour of the cycle. This exclusive distribution will occur alongside the protocol's daily native rewards distribution at the end of each cycle, with eligible recyclers receiving a share based on their veXNF position. In short, recycling in hour 1 means you'll get a portion of that cycle's claim fee proceeds.

This recycling mechanic provides a multitude of benefits for the ecosystem and recyclers. Not only does it provide users the ability to participate in the daily burn auction without providing the mandatory burn fee, but it actively drives buy pressure for XNF and XEN, with a portion of all recycled rewards being utilised to generate protocol-owned liquidity. But that’s not all, as a dedicated recycler, you also unlock the ability to earn additional XEN and XNF rewards in each cycle, stemming from protocol-owned liquidity. This strategic approach empowers users to maximise their earning potential in a way that aligns with protocol growth.

![Grey V4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60996729/235287926-6b18081e-ca41-48c7-8dfc-29cc32c598f1.png)

## ⭐️ Recycling Native Rewards

Discover the smart way to maximise your earning potential with Xenify's recycling feature. By recycling accrued native rewards, you bypass the 25% claim fee and strengthen your XNF position as your full balance enters the daily burn auction. What makes this process unique is the protocol's ability to deduct the burn fee directly from your recycled rewards. This enables fee-free participation, unlike the normal burn process which requires additional native tokens to cover the mandatory burn fee.

As a veXNF holder who recycles, you gain access to an exclusive daily distribution of veXNF and XEN that’s drawn from protocol-owned liquidity. Whereby, 1% of the XNF and XEN LP tokens held by the protocol will be withdrawn at each cycle's end. The native tokens that are obtained from the withdrawal will be used to purchase XNF and XEN, and combined with the withdrawn XNF and XEN tokens. Your share of the distribution depends on the dollar amount of rewards you've recycled. In essence, by recycling more native rewards during a cycle, you can increase your share of the XNF and XEN rewards acquired from the protocol-owned liquidity. Recyclers will be able to freely claim their allocation of XEN rewards at the end of each cycle, however the XNF rewards will be subject to a 1 year lock and distributed as veXNF.

But wait, there's more! As a token of gratitude for their active participation in the protocol, veXNF holders who recycle rewards during the first hour of the cycle also become eligible for an exclusive distribution of native tokens from the 25% claim fee charged on direct claims. At the end of each cycle, accumulated claim fee proceeds will be distributed to eligible recyclers proportional to their XNF holdings and its associated veXNF power. To leverage this recycling feature, ensure that you have a sufficient balance of native rewards to acquire at least one batch for the burn process. If your reward balance falls short of the required amount of native chain tokens, the recycle option will not be accessible to you. 

By recycling your native rewards, you'll not only strengthen your XNF position but also enjoy a streamlined process that eliminates the usual fees associated with the burn function. Most importantly, as a dedicated recycler, you will benefit from native chain tokens generated from the 25% claim fee and qualify for an exclusive distribution of XNF and XEN at the end of each cycle. It's a win-win situation that rewards your active participation and commitment to the growth of Xenify.

![Grey V4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60996729/235287926-6b18081e-ca41-48c7-8dfc-29cc32c598f1.png)

## ⚡️ Recycling Rewards Example

Let's walk through an example to illustrate how the recycling feature works. Imagine you are a veXNF holder on BNB Chain, and you decide to recycle your native chain reward balance of 1.0 BNB during the first hour of the cycle. First, the protocol calculates your burn contribution. Since the batch value is 0.1 BNB on BNB Chain, your 1.0 BNB rewards equate to 10 batches. Your 10 batches will be allocated to either the XEN burn or the YSL burn, depending on which burn has the lowest contribution. Next, your burn fee is deducted from the rewards based on the fee formula. Recycling in hour 1 means your burn fee is 0.49975 BNB.

<br>

$$
BF = (0.5 \times 1) \times (1 - (10 \times 0.00005)) = 0.49975 \space BNB
$$

<br>

50% of the burn fee will be set aside and distributed to eligible veXNF holders at the end of the cycle, and the remaining 50% will be utilised to create XNF protocol-owned liquidity. Then, your remaining 0.50025 BNB rewards split: 50% (0.250125 BNB) is utilised to create XNF protocol-owned liquidity, 25% (0.1250625 BNB) to create XEN protocol-owned liquidity, and 25% (0.1250625 BNB) sent as USDC to the Xenify team. At the end of the cycle, you receive XNF for your 10-batch burn contribution. And, as a recycler, you’ll also be included in an exclusive distribution of veXNF and XEN acquired from protocol-owned liquidity. But that’s not all, as you recycled rewards during the first hour of the cycle you will also receive a share of the BNB collected from the 25% claim fee!

![Grey V4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60996729/235287926-6b18081e-ca41-48c7-8dfc-29cc32c598f1.png)

## ⭐️ Native Token Reward Distribution

During each cycle, the protocol's reward pool gradually accumulates native tokens generated from burn fees and swap fees. This pool grows with every transaction, whether it's a swap or a burn. The total sum of the reward pool is then distributed among veXNF holders based on their XNF holdings and its associated earning power. If there are no veXNF holders at the end of the cycle, the native rewards generated from the swap fees and burn fees will be utilised to create protocol-owned XNF liquidity. This function will only be triggered at the end of a cycle when there are no veXNF holders and all locks are expired.

On top of rewards generated from burn fees and swap fees, the protocol will also perform an exclusive distribution of native tokens derived from the 25% claim fee that’s charged when veXNF holders claim their native rewards. This exclusive distribution will be reserved for veXNF holders who recycle their rewards in the first hour of a cycle. By aligning incentives and putting unused rewards to work, Xenify creates a thriving, sustainable ecosystem that encourages engagement and cultivates a growing user base, helping to fortify the protocol's long-term growth.

# ◽️ XNF Airdrops
![Line Divider - Filled](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60996729/233879462-b465c484-4c2f-4cd2-a126-19529e333d64.png)

<br>

Introducing Xenify's exclusive XNF Airdrop, an initiative aimed at driving user engagement on the platform across multiple EVM chains. To build anticipation for an upcoming launch of XNF on a new chain, a 60-day airdrop event will precede its deployment. As platform users swap tokens, they will be rewarded with a generous allocation of 1,500,000 XNF tokens during this event, providing a fantastic opportunity to benefit from Xenify's growth.

These 1,500,000 XNF tokens will be initially distributed as locked tokens on the launch day, gradually unlocking over a period of 730 days. For instance, if you receive 100 locked XNF tokens from the airdrop, you can expect approximately 0.13699 XNF tokens to be unlocked in your wallet each day. Since these tokens will be divided among swap participants based on their daily swap contributions leading up to the launch, the more you swap during the event, the greater your share of the XNF Airdrop will be! Now, we understand your eagerness to earn from those XNF tokens and witness your portfolio flourish. However, there's a small catch – Airdropped XNF tokens cannot be staked until they unlock in your wallet. So, if you're aiming to earn a share of the platform's native rewards, we highly recommend also taking part in the initial burn auction. It's your ticket to earning a portion of the native rewards from the initial distribution!

To ensure fairness and discourage last-minute sniping, a consistent daily allocation of the airdrop will be implemented throughout the event. This guarantees that participants receive a share of the airdrop that reflects their level of engagement. For example, during the 60-day Genesis Airdrop on the BNB Chain, 25,000 XNF tokens will be allocated each day. Your share from the Genesis airdrop will be based on your daily contributions through the swap fee. Imagine being the sole user who swaps on a particular day during the 60-day event – you'll claim an impressive 25,000 XNF from the airdrop! Furthermore, to maintain engagement, contributions made during an event will not carry over to subsequent airdrops. This policy ensures that users who contribute only once are not consistently included in future airdrops, promoting active participation.

During the pre-deployment phase, while the airdrop event is ongoing, the 0.5% swap fee will not be allocated to veXNF holders. Instead, these fees will be utilised as resources to support the protocol's progression and outreach efforts. However, once XNF has been deployed on a specific chain, 100% of the swap fees generated on that chain will be redirected as daily native rewards to veXNF holders. This creates an attractive incentive for actively participating in the ecosystem's growth and allows users to benefit from Xenify's ongoing swap volume.

<br>

Introducing Xenify's burn amplification, an opportunity exclusively tailored for Class 1 APEX XENFT (Xunicorn), Class 2 APEX XENFT (Exotic), or Phoenix Ape NFT owners. Through ownership of these rare NFTs, you'll unlock a daily amplified burn effect, boosting your batch count by a staggering 100 when burning XEN or YSL. If you own or rent at least four of these sought-after NFTs, prepare yourself for an even bigger amplification, as your wallet will receive a generous daily bonus of 1000 batches. And here's the best part: Your daily batch bonus, whether you possess one NFT or four Phoenix Ape NFTs, can seamlessly be bridged to any chain that Xenify launches. With your burn bonus resetting each day, you'll have the opportunity to reap the benefits of this amplified burn effect across all chains Xenify launches on a daily basis!

To make the Phoenix Apes accessible to a wide range of participants, it will be made available exclusively through a weekly auction. This ensures fairness and engagement, giving everyone ample time to secure their prized Phoenix Ape NFT. The auction starts with a minimum starting bid of just $10 BNB. This means, if no bids have been placed yet, you can kick off the auction with a minimum bid of $10 BNB. If there are existing bids, your bid must be equivalent to 105% of the current highest bid. For instance, if the highest bid is 0.5 BNB, you can jump into the auction and outbid the current highest bidder with 0.525 BNB.

Each weekly auction lasts a minimum of 168 hours, and features a time buffer extension of 5 minutes. This means that if a bid is placed within the last 5 minutes of the auction, an additional 5 minutes will be added to the duration, with the auction only ending when no bids are placed within the last 5 minutes of the scheduled end time. This ensures that no auction will start until the current one concludes, giving everyone a fair chance to participate. For instance, let’s say the auction is set to end at 12:00 pm, and a bid is placed at 11:59 am. The end time will be extended to 12:05 pm, and this process continues until there are no bids within the last five minutes, providing every bidder with a fair opportunity. 

Furthermore, as soon as a higher bid is placed during the auction, the previous highest bidder receives a full refund of their BNB. This guarantees fairness throughout the process, as they can use their refunded BNB to place another bid if they choose to do so. Moreover, 100% of the BNB acquired from the winning bidder will be distributed as rewards to veXNF holders on BNB Chain, further benefiting the Xenify ecosystem. Once you win the auction, you can claim your Phoenix Ape NFT, which mints your unique NFT. It's important to note that only the wallet address associated with the winning bid can claim the Phoenix Ape NFT, ensuring utmost security for all participants. And here's another important detail: if you're the lucky auction winner, you'll need to claim your Phoenix Ape NFT before participating in subsequent auctions. This mechanism prevents any single participant from accumulating unminted NFTs. Let's explore some of the standout features that set Phoenix Ape NFTs apart from conventional NFTs:

![Grey V4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60996729/235287926-6b18081e-ca41-48c7-8dfc-29cc32c598f1.png)

## ⭐️ Limited Collectible

The Phoenix Apes is an NFT collectible that has been designed to unite the Xenify and YSL.IO communities. The exclusive NFT collection developed by YSL.IO, boasts a scarce supply of just 520. These sought-after NFTs have been ingeniously designed with utility at their core. Not only do they possess unique rarities, but they also bestow exceptional benefits upon their holders within the Xenify and YSL.IO ecosystem.

![Grey V4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60996729/235287926-6b18081e-ca41-48c7-8dfc-29cc32c598f1.png)

## ⭐️ Daily Amplified Burn Effect

Prepare to unleash the power of your Phoenix Ape NFT, Class 1 APEX XENFT (Xunicorn), or Class 2 APEX XENFT (Exotic) on Xenify! As a proud owner of these remarkable NFTs, you gain access to an exclusive amplified burn effect that takes your burn contribution to new heights. This unique advantage empowers NFT holders to secure a larger share of the daily distribution of XNF, while also benefiting from significant discounts on their burn fees. By bridging the communities of these exceptional NFTs, this amplified burn effect fosters unity and fuels the growth of each ecosystem, creating a win-win situation for all involved. Here's how it works: When NFT holders decide to burn XEN or YSL on Xenify, they unlock a daily burn bonus that doubles their batch count (NB). The bonus is capped at 100 daily batches per NFT ID. Once a user uses up all 100 daily bonus batches allocated to their NFT, that specific NFT will no longer offer an amplified burn for that day.

Looking for extra firepower? We've got fantastic news! By owning or renting at least 4 of these highly sought-after NFTs, you'll benefit from even greater amplification, with your wallet receiving a daily bonus of 1000 batches. This effectively replaces the default 100 daily bonus batches reserved for each of your four NFT IDs. In short, if you hold 4 NFTs, your total daily bonus will be capped at 1000 batches, not 1,400 batches. Remember, the more batches you burn, the more you save on burn fees. By holding 4 NFTs, you can achieve maximum savings of 75% off your burn fees by burning just 9,000 batches during the first hour of a cycle instead of the usual 10,000. Plus, with Phoenix Ape NFTs having a limited supply of 520, there can only be a maximum of 130 wallet addresses that can seize this extra firepower.

And here's the best part: Your daily batch bonus, whether you have one NFT or four NFTs, can be seamlessly bridged to any chain that Xenify launches. Let's say Xenify expands to Polygon and you hold 4 Phoenix Ape NFTs. Once you've exhausted your daily 1000 batch bonus on the BNB Chain, you can easily bridge the utility of your NFTs to Polygon and enjoy 1000 bonus batches there. With your multiplier resetting every day, you'll have the opportunity to reap the benefits of this amplified burn effect across all chains Xenify launches on a daily basis! 

In summary, Phoenix Ape NFT holders gain a twofold advantage. They enjoy an increased portion of the daily XNF distribution and unlock substantial discounts on the burn fee by burning a greater number of batches. However, keep in mind that the maximum limit for batches per burn transaction (NB) is set at 10,000, and the upper limit for bonus batches per burn transaction remains capped at 1000. The burn fee discount you obtain is represented by the term (1 - (NB x BC)) in the protocols burn fee formula:

<br>

$$
BF = (FC \times VB) \times (1 - (NB \times BC))
$$

<br>

**Where:**

- $BF$ (Burn Fee) - The fee charged for the burn function, paid in the native token of the blockchain.
- $FC$ (Burn Fee Coefficient) - A time-weighted coefficient used to factor in a discount on the burn fee.
- $VB$ (Value of Batches) - The dollar value of batches being burned by the user, influencing the burn fee as the value of batches increases.
- $BC$ (Batch Coefficient) - A time-weighted coefficient used to factor in the discount based on the batches being burned.
- $NB$ (Number of Batches) - The number of batches the user burns, influencing the discount in burn fees as the number of batches increases. This will be capped at 10,000 batches.

## ⭐️ Example: Amplified Burn Effect

Let's take a closer look at how the amplified burn works in different scenarios:

![Grey V4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60996729/235287926-6b18081e-ca41-48c7-8dfc-29cc32c598f1.png)

## ⚡️ Scenario 1: If you hold 4 or more Phoenix Ape NFTs, APEX XENFTs Class 1 or 2

If you hold 4 NFTs burning batches becomes even more rewarding. Your wallet will receive a daily bonus of 1000 batches. This effectively replaces the default 100 daily bonus batches reserved for each of your NFT IDs. In short, if you hold 4 or more NFTs in your wallet, your total daily bonus will be capped at 1000 batches for that wallet. When you choose to burn a batch amount that is less than your current daily bonus, the protocol will double your batch count by using an equivalent amount. For instance, if you have 4 NFTs and a daily bonus of 1000 batches, burning 1 batch will be counted as 2 batches during the burn process. This means that 1 batch will be deducted from your daily NFTs bonus, leaving you with 999 bonus batches for the day on that chain.

On the other hand, if you decide to burn a batch amount greater than your current daily bonus, the protocol will utilise your entire bonus balance. Let's say you have 4 NFTs and a daily bonus of 1000 batches. If you choose to burn the equivalent of 6,000 batches, it will be counted as 7,000 batches during the burn process. The protocol will use your entire daily batch bonus of 1000 for this. As a result, you won't have any bonus batches remaining to use for that particular day on that chain. But don't worry, once the next day begins, your bonus batch count will reset back to 1000.

Additionally, you can choose to bridge the utility of your 4 NFTs to another chain that Xenify has launched. By doing this, you can use an additional 1000 daily bonus batches on that day, effectively giving you 2,000 daily bonus batches. For example, if you've used up your daily bonus on the BNB Chain, you can simply bridge your NFTs' utility to Ethereum and receive 1000 daily bonus batches on Ethereum. You can repeat this process for each chain where Xenify has been deployed.

![Grey V4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60996729/235287926-6b18081e-ca41-48c7-8dfc-29cc32c598f1.png)

## ⚡️ Scenario 2: If you hold between 1 and 3 Phoenix Ape NFTs, APEX XENFTs Class 1 or 2

Each NFT is granted a daily bonus multiplier limited to 100 batches. When burning a specific number of batches, the protocol first verifies if any of your NFTs possess a bonus balance. If so, the protocol uses your bonus balance to increase your batch count. For instance, imagine you have a daily bonus of 100 batches on your NFT and opt to burn 10 batches. The protocol will effectively double your batch count to 20 batches, by utilising 10 of your daily bonus batches. Consequently, 10 batches from your NFT ID's daily bonus will be deducted, leaving 90 bonus batches for that NFT on that day.

However, if you decide to burn an amount exceeding your bonus balance, the protocol will consume the entire balance of your NFT. For example, if your current daily bonus balance is 90 batches and you choose to burn 5,000 batches, the burn process will count it as 5,090 batches, using up the entire 90 batches from your NFT's bonus balance. As a result, 90 bonus batches allocated to the NFT ID will be removed, leaving zero bonus batches for that NFT on that day. Fear not, your bonus batch count will reset to 100 the following day.

Additionally, you have the option to bridge your NFT's utility to another chain where Xenify has launched. By doing so, you can access an extra 100 daily bonus batches on that day, effectively granting you 200 daily bonus batches for your NFT. For example, if you've exhausted your daily bonus on the BNB Chain, simply bridge your NFT's utility to Ethereum and receive 1000 daily bonus batches on Ethereum. This process can be repeated for each chain where Xenify has been deployed.

## ⭐️ Claimable USDC Rewards

When a Phoenix Ape NFT is rented through the Xenify marketplace, a portion of the user's rental income is collected as tax. Combined with a share of royalty taxes, these earnings are then distributed among all Phoenix Ape NFT holders as USDC rewards on the BNB Chain at the end of each 8-hour epoch. These USDC rewards will be available for holders to claim at the end of each 8-hour epoch.

And here's the best part: even if a user decides to bridge their Phoenix NFT from the BNB chain to amplify burns with Xenify on another chain, they'll still be eligible for the USDC distribution. In simpler terms, the claimable USDC rewards on the BNB Chain will be reserved for all addresses that hold the Phoenix Ape NFT, regardless of whether they bridge utility to another chain.

![Grey V4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60996729/235287926-6b18081e-ca41-48c7-8dfc-29cc32c598f1.png)

## ⭐️ Unique Rental Mechanism
  
The Phoenix Ape NFT features a one-of-a-kind rental mechanism that empowers BNB Chain holders to lease their NFT at a predetermined USDC price for a specific duration. By opting to rent out their Phoenix Ape NFT, users actively contribute to the generation of YSL protocol-owned liquidity. 

Moreover, Phoenix Ape NFT holders on the BNB Chain who choose not to rent out their NFT still reap the benefits of this exceptional rental mechanism. They will receive a share of the rental tax generated from users leasing their Phoenix NFT. This tax will be combined with a portion of the royalty tax and distributed to all BNB Chain Phoenix Ape NFT holders as claimable USDC every 8 hours, further rewarding users for their active participation in holding this exclusive NFT.

We understand that you may have questions about Xenify, its features, and its potential. To help you navigate our platform, we've compiled a list of frequently asked questions that provide clarity and insights into Xenify and its ecosystem.

![Grey V4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60996729/235287926-6b18081e-ca41-48c7-8dfc-29cc32c598f1.png)

## ◽️ Does XNF have an initial supply?
  - No, Xenify does not have an initial supply, and there is no pre-mine of XNF tokens. Instead, the protocol rewards users on a daily basis for their active participation in the ecosystem. This is achieved through various contributions, such as burn fee contributions made by directly burning XEN or YSL tokens, as well as swap fees generated through the Xenify aggregator. Notably, 50% of the burn fees and swap fees collected on supported EVM chains are directed towards veXNF holders on a daily basis, providing significant long-term earning potential.

  - By implementing this equitable distribution system, Xenify aims to create a level playing field for all users, preventing any concentration of tokens in the hands of a few early adopters. Instead, the protocol emphasises the importance of ongoing user involvement and contributions, as they directly translate into tangible rewards. This innovative approach distinguishes Xenify as a platform that values its community and actively encourages their participation in shaping the ecosystem.

![Grey V4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60996729/235287926-6b18081e-ca41-48c7-8dfc-29cc32c598f1.png)

## ◽️ What does the recycle button do?
  - The recycle button is a user-friendly feature that prioritises the needs of veXNF holders. By simply clicking this button, users can conveniently convert their accumulated native rewards into XNF through the daily burn auction. This feature brings several advantages. Firstly, it allows you to participate in the burn cycle without incurring the mandatory burn fee associated with the default burn process. This means you can enjoy the benefits of acquiring XNF through the burn cycle while saving on additional fees.

  - Moreover, by choosing to recycle your rewards, you actively contribute to the growth and sustainability of the Xenify ecosystem. After a Burn Fee has been deducted from the recycled rewards, the protocol utilises 50% of your remaining rewards to create XNF liquidity, enabling a more robust and efficient market for the token. Additionally, 25% of the remaining rewards are used to create XEN liquidity, further enhancing the ecosystem's overall liquidity. Lastly, the remaining 25% is sent as USDC to the team, supporting ongoing operational expenses such as platform development, marketing campaigns, and community engagement activities.

  - By recycling your rewards, you not only enhance your own benefits but also play a vital role in the continued success of the Xenify platform. As a result, recyclers will receive an additional exclusive distribution of native chain tokens generated from the platform's claim fees, as well as XEN and XNF stemming from protocol-owned liquidity. This means that by actively participating in the recycling process, you have the opportunity to secure additional rewards, boosting your overall holdings.

  - In conclusion, the recycle button feature not only offers convenience but also presents numerous advantages for veXNF holders. By saving on fees, contributing to ecosystem growth, and accessing exclusive distributions, recyclers can maximise their benefits while supporting the ongoing success of the Xenify platform.

![Grey V4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60996729/235287926-6b18081e-ca41-48c7-8dfc-29cc32c598f1.png)

## ◽️ Why will XNF appreciate in value?
  - The value of XNF holds the potential to appreciate significantly due to Xenify’s innovative tokenomics, thriving ecosystem, and the increasing demand for native rewards. With Xenify's cutting-edge cross-chain aggregator, users can enjoy seamless token swapping and engage in various rewarding activities, which drives protocol adoption and ultimately the value of XNF.

  - Additionally, the scarcity of XNF tokens, brought about by halving events, is likely to boost the token's value as more users choose Xenify as their preferred platform for swapping tokens. This will lead to more native rewards for veXNF holders, resulting in a growing demand for XNF tokens. Consequently, the token value is poised to rise due to demand, cementing Xenify's position as a promising project within the XEN ecosystem.

![Grey V4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60996729/235287926-6b18081e-ca41-48c7-8dfc-29cc32c598f1.png)

## ◽️ If I lock XNF now when can I unlock them?
  - When you choose to lock your XNF, you'll have the opportunity to select a staking cycle that suits your preferences, ranging from a minimum of 1 week to a maximum of 1 year. It's important to note that once you begin the staking cycle, your XNF tokens will be locked, and you won't be able to unlock them until the cycle is completed. Once your chosen staking cycle comes to an end, you'll have the freedom to unlock your XNF tokens, reclaiming full ownership and control over them. By participating in staking, you contribute to the overall health of our ecosystem, and in return, you have the opportunity to earn native rewards on a daily basis!

![Grey V4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60996729/235287926-6b18081e-ca41-48c7-8dfc-29cc32c598f1.png)

## ◽️ How do I generate rewards with Xenify?
  - Xenify offers users the opportunity to earn rewards like ETH, BNB, and MATIC on a daily basis by staking XNF tokens. These rewards are distributed among veXNF holders based on their veXNF balance and the power associated with their veXNF. This incentive model not only encourages active participation but also plays a vital role in fostering the long-term growth and sustainability of the protocol.

![Grey V4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60996729/235287926-6b18081e-ca41-48c7-8dfc-29cc32c598f1.png)

## ◽️ If I lock XNF now when will I receive rewards?
  - When you lock your XNF, you receive a unique ERC-721 non-fungible token (NFT) called veXNF in exchange. This veXNF token represents your locked XNF in the protocol and, more importantly, indicates your earning power - influencing your share of native rewards.

  - The longer you lock your XNF, the greater your veXNF earning power. However, it's important to note this earning power decays over time, even if you opt for the maximum 1-year lock period. This decay mechanic incentivises users to lock for longer terms to maintain higher earning strength for longer.

  - Throughout each cycle, rewards generated from the burn fees and swap fees accumulate in a reward pool, and the protocol distributes the entire reward pool of native chain tokens among veXNF holders at the end of the cycle based on their locked XNF tokens and it’s associated earning power, ensuring a fair and transparent distribution.

![Grey V4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60996729/235287926-6b18081e-ca41-48c7-8dfc-29cc32c598f1.png)

## ◽️ Are there different ways to participate with Xenify?
- Yes, there are several ways to participate with Xenify, including:

  - Utilise the Xenify aggregator to perform seamless single-click swaps and earn XNF in the process.
  - Engage in direct burns of XEN or YSL to acquire XNF.
  - Lock XNF tokens to earn native chain tokens such as ETH, BNB, and MATIC.
  - Purchase a Phoenix Ape NFT to unlock daily amplified burns and more.
  - Contribute to the protocol's growth through community initiatives.

![Grey V4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60996729/235287926-6b18081e-ca41-48c7-8dfc-29cc32c598f1.png)

## ◽️ What happens if there are no token swaps or burns during a daily cycle?
  - In the unlikely event that a cycle passes without any swaps on Xenify and no users burning either XEN or YSL, the daily XNF cycle distribution will not occur. The XNF tokens that were due to be distributed during this cycle won't be minted. Consequently, the overall supply of XNF will be reduced by the number intended for distribution in that cycle. For instance, if the daily allocation for a cycle was set at 20,000 XNF, and no swaps or burns take place during that cycle, then these 20,000 XNF will neither be minted nor distributed. Instead, the total supply of XNF will be reduced by 20,000 XNF at the end of the cycle.

  - But what if a cycle passes where only swaps are undertaken and no burns occur? Well, In this scenario, the designated daily XNF for distribution will be apportioned among the participants of the swap. For instance, if the daily allocation for a cycle is set at 20,000 XNF, and swaps are performed without any burns occurring during that cycle, then the full allocation of 20,000 XNF will be minted and distributed amongst the swap participants.

  - Similarly, in a cycle where only burns are executed with no swaps taking place, the full allocation of XNF scheduled for distribution will be allotted to the participants of the burn auction. For instance, if the daily allocation for a cycle is set at 20,000 XNF, and burns are conducted without any swaps happening during that cycle, then the full allocation of 20,000 XNF will be minted and distributed amongst the participants of the burn auction.

## ◽️What happens to the rewards if there are no veXNF holders?
- If there are no veXNF holders at the end of the cycle, the native rewards generated from the swap fees and burn fees will be utilised to create protocol-owned XNF liquidity. This function will only be triggered at the end of a cycle when there are no veXNF holders and all locks are expired.

Welcome to the Xenify Glossary, your go-to resource for understanding key terms and concepts essential to the Xenify ecosystem and the broader world of decentralised finance (DeFi). Our glossary aims to bridge the gap between complex crypto jargon and everyday language. Using everyday language and straightforward explanations, our glossary will enable you to deepen your knowledge of Xenify, DeFi, and the innovative technologies that bring our protocol to life with clarity and simplicity.

![Grey V4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60996729/235287926-6b18081e-ca41-48c7-8dfc-29cc32c598f1.png)

## ◽️ XEN
  
  - XEN is the inspirational foundation for Xenify, incorporating its innovative Proof of Participation concept and First Principles methodology to build a groundbreaking decentralised protocol.

![Grey V4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60996729/235287926-6b18081e-ca41-48c7-8dfc-29cc32c598f1.png)

## ◽️ XNF 

  - XNF is the native equity token of Xenify, a state-of-the-art cross-chain aggregator protocol in the decentralised finance (DeFi) space. Users can earn XNF tokens by actively participating in the platform's activities, such as burning XEN or YSL tokens and swapping tokens on supported chains.

![Grey V4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60996729/235287926-6b18081e-ca41-48c7-8dfc-29cc32c598f1.png)

## ◽️ veXNF 

  - veXNF is a vested token, embodied as a non-fungible token (NFT) under the ERC-721 standard, representing a user's locked position in XNF. A user's share of the native rewards isn't solely dictated by the quantity of veXNF they possess. It's also influenced by their 'power' or standing within the protocol. This standing is determined by a combination of their veXNF holdings and the length of their lock-in period.

![Grey V4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60996729/235287926-6b18081e-ca41-48c7-8dfc-29cc32c598f1.png)

## ◽️ Direct Burns 

  - When a token is burned it's usually sent to an inactive address and removed from circulation, effectively reducing the total supply by the amount burned. On Xenify, Direct Burns happen when users purposefully burn tokens (XEN or YSL) to promote the growth of the protocol.  As a reward for their commitment to the protocol, users receive XNF tokens in exchange for their burned XEN or YSL tokens.

## ◽️ Proof of Burn

  - Proof of Burn is a commitment mechanism where users burn tokens to show their support for the protocol. In exchange, they receive equity.

## ◽️ Swap Volume 
  
  - Swap volume refers to the total value of token swaps executed on the Xenify platform. It serves as the basis for distributing XNF tokens to users during the daily reward cycle.

## ◽️ First Principles 

  - First principles in crypto are the fundamental concepts that underpin decentralised digital currencies. They focus on permissionless access, transparency, trustlessness, decentralisation, and immutability. These principles guide the growth and innovation of cryptocurrencies, enabling informed decision-making and shaping the future of decentralised finance.

## ◽️ Interoperability

  - Interoperability is the ability of different systems, networks, or platforms to seamlessly work together. It allows for the exchange of data, assets, and information without barriers.

## ◽️ Smart Contracts 

  - Smart Contracts are digital agreements that automatically execute when specific conditions are met, allowing two or more parties to exchange things like money, property, or shares in a transparent and hassle-free way, without needing a middleman. These contracts are like mini-programs stored on a blockchain, and they run as soon as the agreed-upon terms are fulfilled. By automating the process, everyone involved can be confident in the outcome without delays or interference from intermediaries.

## ◽️ DeFi (Decentralised Finance) 

  - DeFi, short for Decentralised Finance, is a financial system that cuts out the middlemen by using blockchain technology. It blends traditional banking with blockchain, replacing some parts of the usual financial system with smart contracts on a blockchain. DeFi delivers financial services on a blockchain, offering a more open, transparent, and user-friendly alternative to traditional financial services.
