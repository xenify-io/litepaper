Welcome to Xenify! Our groundbreaking protocol synergistically blends DBXen’s innovative tokenomics and ChainZap’s powerful functionality into one powerful package, setting the stage for a seismic shift in the DeFi landscape. With a maximum total supply of only 21,500,000 XNF tokens, Xenify empowers users to earn XNF while simultaneously functioning as a first-layer burner for the XEN token. Our overarching mission? To revolutionise the DeFi space with a seamless, ultra-efficient cross-chain swapping experience that lavishes users with Native Chain Rewards and a token with a finite supply.

At the core of Xenify's bold vision is ChainZap, a cutting-edge liquidity aggregation protocol that streamlines cross-chain token swaps. Whether you want to swap tokens on Ethereum, BNB Chain, Polygon, Arbitrum, or any of the 36 supported chains, Xenify has you covered. With access to 19 different aggregators, Xenify guarantees unparalleled liquidity and optimal rates for your swaps. By leveraging cutting-edge APIs, Xenify bridges seamless communication with a wide array of DEX aggregators, dramatically enhancing the swapping experience and streamlining the quest for optimal swap routes across the vast tapestry of chains.

With Xenify's built-in swap and burn fee mechanisms, a reciprocal environment that benefits all participants is established. Wherein XNF stakers are generously rewarded with a substantial 50% of swap fees and an impressive 100% of burn fees as Native Chain Rewards across all supported chains. That's right, stakers earn from every swap and burn!

The remaining 50% of swap fees are strategically allocated to support Xenify's ongoing development, marketing, and outreach initiatives. This approach enables us to enhance visibility, drive adoption, and champion sustainable growth, all for the benefit of our users and the protocol itself.

What's more, Xenify's innovative design has enabled the seamless integration of the YSL.IO protocol, incorporating its state-of-the-art AlphaVaults and MetaVaults into the daily reward distribution process. Thanks to this integration, an incredible 100% of yields obtained from the rehypothecation of vault assets are directed straight to Xenify, fuelling development and rewarding XNF stakers. In return, YSL.IO acquires an XNF position and channels 100% of the Native Chain Rewards it earns to vault participants. This win-win strategy guarantees a continuous flow of Native Chain Rewards for XNF stakers and ensures Xenify's expansion, even without swaps or burns. As a result, long-term user engagement is fostered for both Xenify and YSL.IO, and rewards are boosted for those who are truly dedicated to each protocol.

At the heart of Xenify's ethos is a steadfast commitment to fairness and transparency, embodied by our exemplary token distribution model. There will be no team, founder, or investor allocation. In fact, the only way to mint XNF tokens is through active participation in the ecosystem - by either burning or swapping tokens. This approach certifies a genuinely equitable distribution of XNF tokens, rewarding users for their contributions and fostering a truly community-driven protocol.

As we bring together the cutting-edge liquidity aggregation of ChainZap and our own distinctive tokenomics, Xenify is poised to redefine the landscape of cross-chain swapping, all while nurturing a thriving ecosystem that places utmost importance on user satisfaction and sustainable growth. Join us as we take a leap into the future, and experience the world of Xenify - a realm where innovation meets reward, where community powers expansion, and where the foundation for DeFi's bright tomorrow is being laid. Welcome to the revolution!

![Grey V4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60996729/235287926-6b18081e-ca41-48c7-8dfc-29cc32c598f1.png)

## ♦️ Staking

- Xenify integrates a dynamic staking rewards mechanism that offers significant benefits to XNF stakers. By staking XNF tokens, users become eligible to receive a resounding 100% of burn fees and 50% of generated swap fees on supported chains as Native Chain Rewards. But that’s not all! Owing to Xenify's seamless integration with the YSL.IO protocol, an additional layer of rewards is offered to XNF stakers. Within this framework, a full 100% of the yield generated from the rehypothecation of YSL.IO AlphaVault and MetaVault assets are redirected to Xenify, with 50% shared amongst XNF stakers. This equitable incentive model ensures that active participants in the ecosystem are amply rewarded, helping us foster a vibrant and engaged community.

![Grey V4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60996729/235287926-6b18081e-ca41-48c7-8dfc-29cc32c598f1.png)

## ♦️ Token Burning

- If users want to acquire XNF tokens, they can do so by burning vXEN and vUSDy tokens. Think of vXEN and vUSDy as virtual counterparts of XEN and USDy, respectively. These tokens have been designed exclusively for the purpose of converting into XNF. 

- To get your hands on vXEN, you'll need XEN tokens or a version of the XEN token supported by Xenify. For example, if you have bXEN (the XEN token residing on the BNB Chain), you can easily convert it into vXEN. And once you have vXEN, you can burn it to participate in Xenify’s daily distribution of XNF tokens. Both the bXEN and vXEN you provide are burned by the protocol, removing them from circulation. It's as straightforward as that. Keep in mind that the conversion rate will be fixed but may vary based on the version of the XEN token you're exchanging.

- Similarly, if you're interested in obtaining vUSDy, you'll need to possess YSL.IO native tokens like bYSL, xYSL, or USDy. For example, if you have bYSL, you can easily convert it into vUSDy. And once you have vUSDy, you can burn it to participate in Xenify’s daily distribution of XNF tokens. Both the bYSL and vUSDy you provide are burned by the protocol, removing them from circulation. Just like with vXEN, the conversion rate for vUSDy is fixed, but it depends on the specific YSL.IO native token you're exchanging.

- Now, you may be wondering why we've integrated the burning of XEN and USDy tokens. Well, it's not just a smart move to reduce the circulating supply of both these tokens; it's also a powerful way to connect our communities. We want to strengthen both the XEN and YSL.IO ecosystems while strategically unifying our communities under a shared vision.

![Grey V4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60996729/235287926-6b18081e-ca41-48c7-8dfc-29cc32c598f1.png)

## ♦️ Cross-Chain Swapping

- Xenify's integration with ChainZap enables users to execute seamless cross-chain swaps, making it easier than ever to exchange tokens across different chains. Our streamlined process offers a new level of simplicity in cross-chain token swaps and provides access to the most competitive rates available, while delivering an efficient and user-friendly DeFi experience like never before.

![Grey V4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60996729/235287926-6b18081e-ca41-48c7-8dfc-29cc32c598f1.png)

## ♦️ Fair Equity Distribution

- Xenify is dedicated to promoting fairness and transparency in the distribution of equity among its users. Our unique tokenomics and staking model are designed to reward active participants and long-term holders, creating a strong incentive for users to contribute to the growth of our ecosystem. As our community continues to grow, the equitable distribution of rewards and XNF tokens ensures that everyone benefits, promoting a vibrant and engaged community.

# ◽️ XEN Overview 
![Line Divider - Filled](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60996729/233879462-b465c484-4c2f-4cd2-a126-19529e333d64.png)

XEN is a project that was launched on the principles of self-custody, trustless consensus, and decentralisation. It is a joint effort of several blockchain enthusiasts who aim to create a fairer, more transparent mining ecosystem.

One of the main goals of XEN is to democratise mining by providing a decentralised platform that allows anyone to participate in the mining process. This is achieved by utilising a Proof-of-Work (PoW) consensus algorithm that is resistant to ASIC mining, thus ensuring that the network remains accessible to individual miners.

In addition to its mining capabilities, XEN also features a native cryptocurrency, the XEN token, which is used to incentivise miners and maintain the security of the network. XEN tokens are also used to pay for transaction fees and other network services.

XEN operates on a Proof of Participation (PoP) system, which allows participants to mint their coins. The XEN smart contract employs a fair distribution system based on reward time locks and the total number of participants. XEN's value is linked to its difficulty to be minted, similar to Bitcoin. As more participants join and mint XEN, the total amount of generated XEN drops, making it more scarce and valuable.

One of the key features of XEN is its simplicity, as it is based on the ERC20 token standard with minimal code, no pre-minting, hidden doors, admin keys, or origin wallets. Furthermore, XEN has a supply of zero and can only be minted by the participating community. This makes it inflationary at the beginning and disinflationary as adoption increases. XEN is immutable and has no backing by investors or intrinsic value.

To mint XEN, participants can connect their Ethereum-compatible wallets to the XEN smart contract and specify the number of days they are willing to wait to receive XEN. The smart contract generates a XEN rank (cRANK) based on how many people interacted with the contract before the participant. Participants can also stake XEN for 1 to 1,000 days, with APY rewards starting at 20% on XEN Genesis and decreasing by 1 percentage point every 90 days until it reaches 2%, where it will remain indefinitely.

Overall, XEN represents an innovative approach to mining that emphasises decentralisation, accessibility, and sustainability. XEN's combination of features, simplicity and fairness make it a unique and promising project in the crypto space.

# ◽️ USDy Overview 
![Line Divider - Filled](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60996729/233879462-b465c484-4c2f-4cd2-a126-19529e333d64.png)

USDy is a reward token that incentivizes participation in the YSL.IO ecosystem with stability and sustainability at its core. Developed with cutting-edge tokenomincs, the YSL.IO protocol boasts a host of innovative features that make USDy a standout reward token in the DeFi landscape.

One of the key highlights of USDy is its Price Stability Model (PSM), which ensures a continuous increase in liquidity, even in the face of sell pressure. The protocol achieves this through a combination of autonomous Treasury-Owned Liquidity creation and an ingenious Buyback and Burn feature (UBB), which actively works to stabilise the price of USDy.

Here's how it works: the UBB is activated every 4-epochs if the USDy pool price falls below $0.95. During this time, a portion of the tax from every trade of YSL, xYSL, bYSL, and USDy will be used to purchase and/or burn USDy. Additionally, 15% of every HydraVault deposit will also be used to purchase and burn USDy.

What's more, the protocol generates Treasury-Owned Liquidity for USDy at every point of user interaction, ensuring that as more users join the YSL.IO ecosystem, USDy's liquidity grows autonomously. And to further reduce the supply of USDy and increase its price, the Incentive Buyback mechanism (UIB) kicks in every time someone purchases the YSL token using ChainZap. This mechanism incorporates a 25% incentive to purchase YSL while actively reducing the supply of USDy.

Here's how it works: all of the USDC sent will be used to purchase and burn USDy equivalent to 175%, and as a bonus, users receive a complimentary 25% USDy for each purchase. The result is a reduction in USDy supply and an increase in its price, benefiting USDy holders.

In conclusion, USDy has been carefully crafted by YSL.IO with a focus on price stability, and liquidity growth. With innovative features like UBB and UIB, USDy liquidity will continue to grow autonomously while its price remains stable, creating a sustainable, less volatile, and more robust ecosystem.

Introducing Xenify, not just an aggregator of aggregators, but a cross-chain aggregator of aggregators! Expertly designed to streamline the swapping process for users traversing multiple chains, Xenify's capabilities are truly unparalleled. Powered by ChainZap, an advanced liquidity aggregation protocol, Xenify connects to 19 different aggregators, delivering exceptional liquidity and unbeatable rates across 36 leading chains. Swapping tokens between Ethereum, BNB Chain, Polygon, and many more has never been more effortless.

Imagine this scenario: a user wishes to swap Token-A on Ethereum for Token-B on BNB Chain. With Xenify, the swap is executed with a single click and a single transaction on Ethereum. No more complicated chain navigation or price hunting – Xenify takes care of everything, providing the best available rates.

But there's more! Xenify is not just a platform for cross-chain swaps; it's a meticulously crafted ecosystem with unique tokenomics, utilising swap and burn fee mechanisms to benefit all participants. The optional 0.5% swap fee, which users can choose to pay when making a swap, not only fuels Xenify's competitive edge but also rewards Xenify users and XNF stakers. It's a true win-win!

Here's how it works: When users opt to pay the swap fee, they not only facilitate their transactions but also secure a position in the daily XNF reward cycle. From the swap fee, 50% is allocated to support the team in funding future audits, development, and marketing efforts, while the remaining 50% is distributed as native chain rewards to staked XNF holders on supported chains. That's right – XNF stakers can benefit from every swap on supported chains!

Furthermore, Xenify's design incorporates an ingenious burn mechanism that enables users to burn XEN and USDy tokens to mint XNF, positioning the XEN burning process as a strategic layer 2 burner of XEN. But here's the best part: a staggering 100% of burn fees are channelled back to XNF stakers.

Xenify's built-in swap and burn fee mechanisms help create a reciprocal environment that rewards platform users with XNF as part of the daily reward cycle, and XNF stakers with a generous 100% of burn fees and 50% of swap fees across all supported chains. The team's portion of the swap fee is instrumental in promoting and enhancing the Xenify platform and its associated tokens (XEN, USDy, and XNF), ensuring increased awareness and adoption. This strategy not only fosters user engagement but also amplifies rewards for those deeply involved with the protocol.

In addition to the swap and burn fees, XNF stakers will also benefit from Xenify's strategic integration of the YSL.IO protocol. This secondary layer of Xenify's framework rewards XNF stakers from the yield derived from the rehypothecation of assets deposited in YSL.IO’s state-of-the-art AlphaVaults and MetaVaults, ensuring that even if there are no swaps or burns performed on the platform, XNF stakers still receive Native Chain Rewards. This innovative approach to staking and rewards, paired with Xenify's unique tokenomics model, guarantees that the platform will remain ahead of the curve, attract a growing user base, and contribute to the project's overall success.

In summary, Xenify is the ultimate cross-chain aggregator of aggregators that provides users with unparalleled simplicity and efficiency when swapping tokens across 32 leading chains. With a thoughtfully designed ecosystem, Xenify's unique tokenomics model benefits all participants, from platform users to XNF stakers. Xenify truly offers the best of both worlds: effortless cross-chain token swapping and significant earning potential. Whether executing cross-chain token swaps or burning tokens to mint XNF, every action taken on the Xenify platform contributes to a reciprocal environment of rewards and engagement. With Xenify, users can experience the best rates, earn XNF, and be part of a vibrant community - making it the go-to choice for anyone looking to simplify the cross-chain swapping process while maximising their earning potential.

Xenifiy is a groundbreaking protocol that champions fairness, sustainability, and user engagement. At the heart of its tokenomics structure lies XNF, the platform's native token. XNF serves as the primary incentive for users, with a limited supply of 21.5 million. By engaging in a multitude of protocol activities such as burning, staking and swapping tokens, users are rewarded, fostering a dynamic ecosystem where benefits accrue based on contributions and involvement. With this thoughtful design, Xenify guarantees a level playing field for all users, creating an environment where everyone can reap the rewards and laying the foundation for an equitable, community-driven platform.

## ◽️ Token Supply

XNF is the lifeblood of the Xenify protocol, and features a limited total supply of 21.5 million tokens. The distribution process for XNF is designed with transparency and equity in mind, ensuring a level playing field for all. 

With no pre-mines, investor allocations, founder allocations, or team allocations, the Xenify protocol fosters an environment of fairness and inclusivity. Users have the opportunity to earn XNF equity by engaging in various activities, such as burning vXEN or vUSDy tokens and swapping tokens across supported chains. This unique token supply model not only promotes active participation but also cultivates a thriving, community-focused ecosystem that everyone can be a part of.

## ◽️ Supply Distribution

Xenify's total supply of XNF tokens is capped at 21.5 million, and strategically divided into three core segments. The allocation comprises 10,500,000 XNF tokens designated for direct burns of vXEN and vUSDy, an additional 10,500,000 XNF tokens reserved for swap volume, and a separate 500,000 XNF tokens earmarked for the launch airdrop. The airdrop will be distributed over a period of 365 days, with eligible participants receiving XNF on each new block.

Drawing inspiration from Bitcoin, Xenify's distribution model adopts the halving principle.  As demonstrated in the graph below, following the 7th halving, Xenify's daily distribution rate stabilises, ensuring a consistent output of 156.25 XNF tokens per day until the maximum supply is reached in month 2112.

With Xenify's halving model applying equally to both direct burns and swap volume distributions, it guarantees a fair distribution of the daily reward pool among active users. This can be in the form of burning tokens to acquire XNF or by utilising Xenify on supported chains to execute swaps. This distinctive strategy has been thoughtfully engineered to ensure an equitable supply distribution centred around users' active participation, underscoring Xenify's steadfast dedication to fostering an equitable and engaged community.

## ◽️ Potential Expansion Chains

Xenify is getting ready to go big, sizing up a bunch of blockchains for its next big move. How are we going to decide which one to choose? It's simple - airdrop participation. Our strategy is to collect at least $10,000 in native tokens from any chain before we start the deployment process. The list of chains we're checking out right now is quite a mixed bag, from heavyweights like Ethereum, Polygon, and Arbitrum to the new kids on the blockchain like zkEVM and zkSync, there's no shortage of options. The full list includes:

- KCC
- Celo
- Fuse
- Boba
- Heco

## ◽️ vXEN: Unifying the XEN Ecosystem

Introducing vXEN, a groundbreaking solution by Xenify that enables seamless burning of XEN across all chains, unifying the XEN ecosystem and supporting its deflationary nature. This innovative approach has been made possible through the integration of Alexar, a decentralised protocol that breaks down barriers between cross-chain communication with its comprehensive protocol suite.

Now, users are no longer required to hold the native XEN token based on the Ethereum network to participate in the burn process. Instead, Xenify empowers users from the wider XEN ecosystem to effortlessly burn their native XEN tokens from various EVM-compatible networks for vXEN directly from their wallets.

This solution stems from Xenify's dedication to the interoperability of the XEN ecosystem and the shared vision of making Xenify accessible to XEN holders (or Xenians) across multiple chains. This enables Xenify to be seamlessly interoperable with any chain supported by the XEN ecosystem and positions Xenify's burn process as a strategic layer 2 burner of XEN.

vXEN can be thought of as the virtual counterpart of XEN tokens, designed solely to facilitate the conversion of native XEN token variants into XNF tokens. It's important to note that acquiring vXEN requires XEN tokens or a XEN token variant supported by Xenify, such as bXEN on the BNB Chain.

Once you possess vXEN, you can burn it to participate in Xenify's daily distribution of XNF tokens. With each XEN variant having a fixed conversion rate, it eliminates the guesswork from determining how much XEN you're required to burn as a batch. In other words, users can always be confident in the amount of vXEN they'll obtain when burning their native XEN tokens. Please bear in mind that although the conversion rate for vXEN remains fixed, it will vary depending on the specific version of the XEN token you choose to exchange, as outlined in the table below:


|Network     | Native XEN Token | vXEN Conversion Rate  |
|-------------|------------------|-----------------|
| Ethereum    | XEN              | 1 XEN = 1 vXEN  |
| Avalanche   | aXEN             | 67 aXEN = 1 vXEN   |
| Binance     | bXEN             | 108 bXEN = 1 vXEN  |
| Polygon     | mXEN             | 144 mXEN = 1 vXEN  |
| MoonBeam    | mbXEN            | 372 mbXEN = 1 vXEN |
| Fantom      | fmXEN            | 529 fmXEN = 1 vXEN  |
| OKX         | okXEN            | 1380 okXEN = 1 vXEN |
| Evmos       | coXEN            | 3349 coXEN = 1 vXEN |

The minting process for XNF has been meticulously designed to reward users who actively contribute to Xenify's growth through various activities. This approach promotes an equitable distribution of XNF tokens, cultivating a truly decentralised and community-driven protocol.

Likewise, Xenify's incentive structure has been carefully crafted to motivate users to actively participate in the protocol's growth. Users who engage more with the platform receive a proportionate share of the newly minted XNF tokens, fuelling further involvement.

XNF tokens are distributed in one-day cycles, with the reward pool commencing at 20,000 XNF tokens. This initial allocation is divided into two categories: 50% is designated for users who burn vXEN or vUSDy tokens, while the remaining 50% is apportioned between contributions through the platform's 0.5% swap fee and contributions obtained from the yield generated from the rehypothecation of YSL.IO AlphaVault and MetaVault assets.

With the halving model in place, the daily reward pool diminishes over time and ultimately leads to the complete distribution of the 21.5 million XNF tokens at month 2112. Users that stake XNF tokens will accumulate native token rewards that are generated on the Xenify platform from swap fees and burn fees (e.g., ETH, BNB, MATIC).

Additionally, XNF stakers will benefit from Xenify's strategic integration of the YSL.IO protocol, with 100% of the yield generated from assets deposited in YSL.IO AlphaVaults and MetaVaults being routed to Xenify to fuel development (50%) and reward XNF stakers (50%).

This innovative three-pronged incentive model not only helps generate swap volume with users seeking to earn XNF but also rewards user participation through burning and staking. Ultimately, this approach fosters platform growth and cultivates a thriving, engaged user base.

### ♦️ Burn to earn XNF 
  - The Xenify platform empowers its users by providing the ability to burn vXEN and vUSDy tokens, resulting in the minting of XNF. vXEN and vUSDy are virtual counterparts of XEN and USDy tokens, respectively. Their sole purpose is to facilitate the conversion into XNF tokens. 

  - It's important to note that acquiring vXEN requires XEN tokens or a XEN token variant supported by Xenify, such as bXEN on the BNB Chain. Once you possess vXEN, you can burn it to participate in Xenify's daily distribution of XNF tokens. During this burn process, both the XEN token variant and vXEN token are permanently removed from circulation. Please bear in mind that the conversion rate for vXEN remains fixed, although it may vary depending on the specific version of the XEN token you choose to exchange.

  - Similarly, users interested in obtaining vUSDy will need YSL.IO native tokens like bYSL, xYSL, or USDy. Once you have acquired vUSDy, you can take part in Xenify's daily distribution of XNF tokens by burning it. Just like with vXEN burn process, the protocol ensures that both the bYSL and vUSDy tokens are removed from circulation. It is worth noting that the conversion rate for vUSDy remains fixed, but it depends on the specific YSL.IO native token you opt to exchange.

  - Xenify distinguishes itself by integrating this unique burn mechanism, positioning the protocol as a key player in the strategic layer 1 burning of XEN tokens. This strategic approach extends beyond simply reducing the circulating supply of XEN and USDy tokens. Xenify aspires to unify the XEN and YSL.IO ecosystems, fostering a shared vision that brings both communities together.

### ♦️ Swap to earn XNF 
  - Xenify is a pioneering cross-chain aggregator of aggregators that transforms the way users experience token exchanges.  With its seamless single-click transactions and the opportunity to earn XNF tokens, Xenify sets itself apart from the competition.

  - By swapping with Xenify and choosing to pay the swap fee, users actively contribute to the platform's growth. The 0.5% swap fee is divided, with half being distributed as rewards to XNF stakers, celebrating those who fully engage with the protocol. The remaining portion of the fee is utilised by the team to promote and enhance the Xenify platform and its associated tokens (XEN, USDy, and XNF), ensuring increased awareness and adoption.

  - What truly sets Xenify apart from other platforms is the added benefit users receive when opting to pay the swap fee. Users can increase their XNF holdings through daily XNF token distributions, making Xenify a rewarding experience. Users not only enjoy a seamless cross-chain token swapping experience but also earn XNF in the process.

  - The XNF rewards can either be collected by the user or staked to earn even more from the native tokens generated from swap and burn fees. As a result, users benefit from the efficiency and competitive rates offered by Xenify while earning rewards and  actively participating in shaping the future of Xenify's dynamic ecosystem.


![Grey V4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60996729/235287926-6b18081e-ca41-48c7-8dfc-29cc32c598f1.png)

### ♦️ Stake XNF to earn native tokens 
  - Distinguishing itself from generic aggregators, Xenify takes pride in its innovative staking model that incorporates a burn fee and swap fee distribution mechanism, as well as a secondary layer involving the YSL.IO protocol. This unique approach empowers platform users to execute seamless swaps and embark on a rewarding journey by staking the XNF tokens acquired from daily distributions.

  - XNF token stakers play an essential role in Xenify's long-term growth, and in return reap the benefits of a proportionate share of burn and swap fees generated across all supported chains. As Xenify continues to broaden its reach, an increasing amount of swap volume is guaranteed, with users eager to benefit from a seamless swapping experience while earning XNF on every swap they make. This, in turn, leads to increased Native Chain Rewards for XNF stakers! This equitable model establishes a positive feedback loop, guaranteeing that all participants can benefit from the ecosystem's growth in proportion to their engagement.

  - But that's not all! XNF stakers will also benefit from Xenify's strategic integration of the YSL.IO protocol. This secondary layer of Xenify's framework rewards XNF stakers from the yield derived from the rehypothecation of YSL.IO AlphaVault and MetaVault assets, ensuring that even if there are no swaps or burns performed on the platform, XNF stakers still receive Native Chain Rewards.

  - Here's how it works: every day, the protocol distributes 100% of burn fees (originating from direct burns of vXEN or vUSDy), 50% of YSL.IO AlphaVault and MetaVault yields, and 50% of the platform's swap fees (generated on supported chains) to XNF stakers. These rewards are allocated in the form of native chain tokens—a highly liquid asset—signalling a potentially lucrative return for users staking XNF.

  - Xenify's innovative staking model enables users to stake their XNF tokens for an opportunity to receive a steady stream of exceptional rewards in the form of Native Chain Rewards. This distinctive rewards distribution model not only strengthens the demand and value for XNF but also serves as an added incentive for holders to stake their daily distribution of XNF. This strategy has been integrated to encourage long-term engagement with the protocol while cultivating a growing user base.


![Grey V4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60996729/235287926-6b18081e-ca41-48c7-8dfc-29cc32c598f1.png)

## ◽️ Costs of Swapping on Xenify

Xenify offers a ground-breaking token swap solution that not only simplifies cross-chain transactions but also rewards its platform users, all the while nurturing the expansion of its ecosystem. By implementing an optional 0.5% fee on every token swap, Xenify achieves three fundamental objectives: rewarding Xenify platform users, providing native chain rewards to XNF stakers, and fortifying the continuous development of the protocol.

Here's how it works: When a user initiates a token swap on Xenify, they have the option to pay a 0.5% swap fee. This fee is strategically divided to promote future growth and incentivise user participation. A portion of 0.25% is allocated to XNF stakers in the form of native chain tokens, recognising their valuable contribution to the ecosystem. The remaining 0.25% is designated for the Xenify team, funding essential operational expenses such as platform development, marketing campaigns, and community engagement initiatives.

By choosing to pay the nominal 0.5% swap fee, users not only facilitate their transactions but also secure a position in the daily XNF reward cycle. These XNF rewards can be collected by the user or strategically staked to unlock even greater gains from the native tokens generated through swap and burn fees. Consequently, users enjoy the benefits of Xenify's efficiency and competitive rates, all while reaping rewards and actively shaping the evolution of Xenify's dynamic ecosystem.

![Grey V4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60996729/235287926-6b18081e-ca41-48c7-8dfc-29cc32c598f1.png)

## ◽️ Costs of Burning on Xenify

The Xenify protocol enables users to engage in the burning of vXEN or vUSDy tokens to secure XNF from the daily XNF reward cycle. Think of vXEN and vUSDy as virtual counterparts of XEN and USDy, respectively. These tokens have been specifically created for seamless conversion into XNF.

To acquire vXEN, you simply need to have XEN tokens or any XEN token variant supported by Xenify. For instance, if you hold bXEN (the XEN token on the BNB Chain), you can easily convert it into vXEN. Once you obtain vXEN, you can burn it to participate in Xenify's daily distribution of XNF tokens. Both the bXEN and vXEN you contribute will be permanently removed from circulation. It's that simple. Just bear in mind that the conversion rate is fixed, though it may vary depending on the specific version of the XEN token you're exchanging.

Likewise, if you're looking to burn vUSDy, you'll need to possess YSL.IO native tokens such as bYSL, xYSL, or USDy. For example, by holding bYSL, you can easily convert it into vUSDy. Once you possess vUSDy, you can burn it to participate in Xenify's daily distribution of XNF tokens. Both the bYSL and vUSDy you provide will be permanently removed from circulation. Similar to vXEN, the conversion rate for vUSDy remains fixed, but it is contingent upon the particular YSL.IO native token you're exchanging.

By participating in the burning of vXEN and vUSDy, users will encounter specific costs such as transaction gas fees and a mandatory burn fees. However, the burn fee calculation has been meticulously designed to not only ensure a transparent and consistent method for token burning but also reward users with attractive discounts on their burn fees of up to 50%.

The burn fee is determined using this formula:

<br>

$$
BF = GS \times (1 - (NB \times CS)) \times NB
$$

<br>

- $BF$ - Burn fee charged for the burn function, paid in the native token of the chain.
- $GS$ - The total amount of gas consumed by the burn function to execute the code.
- $CS$ - The constant 0.00005, used to factor in the discount on the burn fee.
- $NB$ - The number of batches the user burns, influencing the discount in burn fees as the number of batches increases.

<br>

Our ingenious burn fee calculation takes various factors into consideration: including the gas consumed by the burn function, the number of batches, and a discount factor based on the number of batches. This powerful combination serves as a compelling incentive for users to undertake larger burn operations. And the best part? The more batches a user burns, the greater the discount they will enjoy, with potential savings of up to 50% off for 10,000 batches. But what exactly is a batch? A batch represents a fixed number of tokens, either vXEN or vUSDy, that have been set aside for burning. 

Here’s how it works: To initiate the burn function on Xenify, users must have a wallet balance that meets or exceeds the “Number of Batches” multiplied by a fixed number of tokens, depending on the token type being burned. The protocol calculates the Burn fee by multiplying the Gas Spent (GS) by a factor that depends on the Number of Batches (NB) and the constant (CS). The more batches a user burns, the greater the discount on the burn fee. This discount is represented by the term (1 - (NB x CS)).

By implementing this calculation, we ensure that users receive discounts in proportion to the volume of a specific token (vXEN or vUSDy) they burn. Furthermore, we are proud to emphasise that 100% of the burn fees collected are directed toward XNF stakers. This approach not only encourages efficiency but also rewards our valuable contributors, establishing a mutually beneficial ecosystem. Plus, with the maximum discount set at an impressive 50% for 10,000 batches, the more users burn, the more they save! This exciting prospect not only offers substantial benefits for users but also generates enhanced rewards for XNF stakers.

![Grey V4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60996729/235287926-6b18081e-ca41-48c7-8dfc-29cc32c598f1.png)

## ◽️ XNF Cycle Distribution

Xenify adopts a balanced approach to reward distribution, focusing on essential components of the protocol: burn fees, swap fees, and contributions from the YSL.IO protocol. Each element is granted an allocation of the daily reward cycle distribution, with 50% reserved for token burns, and the remaining 50% apportioned between swap fee contributions and contributions from YSL.IO vaults. For instance, if the daily XNF cycle distribution is 20,000 XNF tokens, Xenify will divide the rewards, allocating 10,000 XNF for burn fee contributions and 10,000 XNF between swap fee contributions and YSL.IO vault contributions.

To ascertain each user's allocation of the daily distribution of XNF tokens, the protocol will perform a series of calculations. These calculations will be based on the swap and burn contributions made during the cycle. The protocol will consolidate these contributions to accurately compute the total XNF distribution for each user. This methodical approach ensures an equitable distribution, crediting both the user's active engagement in token burns and their contribution in terms of swap fees.

The protocol calculates the burn contribution (BC) of a specific user in a cycle, based on the total XNF tokens distributed (TCD), the total number of batches burned by all users (TBB), and the number of batches burned by the specific user (UBB). Here's the formula explained in detail:

<br>

$$
BC = (TCD \div 2) \times (UBB \div TBB)
$$

<br>

**Where:**

- *BC* - represents the burn contribution of the user.
- *TCD* - is the total amount of XNF tokens distributed in a cycle.
- *UBB* - is the number of batches a specific user has burned in a cycle.
- *TBB* - is the total number of batches burned in a cycle by all users.

<br>

Here’s how it works: The protocol calculates the burn contribution by first dividing the total tokens distributed during a cycle (TCD) by 2, as half of the XNF daily reward cycle is allocated to participants that burn vXEN or vUSDy. It then calculates the proportion of batches burned by the specific user (UBB) to the total batches burned by all users (TBB). This results in a value per batch burned. Finally, the protocol multiplies these two values to determine the user's individual burn contribution within that cycle (BC).

The calculation of the swap contribution follows a similar logic, whereby the protocol calculates the swap contribution (SC) of a specific user in a cycle, based on the total XNF tokens distributed (TCD), the total swap fees paid by all users (TSF), and the swap fees paid by the specific user (USF). Here's the formula explained in detail:

<br>

$$
SC = (TCD \div 2) \times (USF \div TSF)
$$

<br>

**Where:**

- *SC* - represents the swap contribution of the user.
- *TCD* - is the total amount of XNF tokens distributed in a cycle.
- *USF* - is the swap fees paid by a specific user in a cycle.
- *TSF* - is the total swap fees paid in a cycle by all users.

<br>

Here’s how it works: The protocol calculates the user's swap contribution (SC) by first dividing the total XNF tokens distributed (TCD) by 2, as half of the XNF daily reward cycle is allocated to participants that perform swaps on supported chains. It then multiplies the result by the ratio of the user's swap fees (USF) to the total swap fees (TSF) paid by all users. This generates a specific value for each unit of swap fee paid and helps in determining the proportion of XNF tokens a user receives based on their individual contribution to the swap fees in a given cycle.

## ◽️ Automatic Staking of XNF Tokens

Both unclaimed and staked XNF tokens contribute to the accumulation of native chain rewards, with each user's share determined by their stake in the total native chain reward pool. Crafted with users at the forefront, the Xenify protocol incorporates an automated staking mechanism to guarantee that all uncollected XNF tokens are seamlessly staked on the user's behalf.

This means that holders can reap the benefits of accruing native chain rewards without the inconvenience of collecting and staking XNF tokens during each cycle. For users who prefer a hands-on approach, manual staking of tokens is also an option. By staking already collected or unstaked XNF tokens, users have the opportunity to amplify their rewards.

When the Xenify protocol automatically stakes XNF tokens, the tokens will adhere to the two-cycle unstaking rule, whereby staked XNF tokens are held for two full daily cycles, even during any 'gap cycles'. Once the two cycles have passed, users have the option to unstake their XNF tokens, regaining total ownership.

![Grey V4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60996729/235287926-6b18081e-ca41-48c7-8dfc-29cc32c598f1.png)

## ◽️ Collecting XNF Token

Upon the conclusion of each cycle, users have the opportunity to collect their allocation of the daily XNF distribution. However, collecting XNF is not mandatory as all uncollected XNF tokens are automatically staked by the protocol. This will allow users to reap the benefits of native chain rewards. On the other hand, users may decide to collect their XNF for trading purposes. Whatever the preference, Xenify offers flexibility and control for every user.

![Grey V4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60996729/235287926-6b18081e-ca41-48c7-8dfc-29cc32c598f1.png)

## ◽️ Unstaking XNF Tokens

To promote a secure and efficient ecosystem, staked XNF tokens are held for two full daily cycles, even during any 'gap cycles'. After the initial cycle, staked tokens begin to accumulate native chain rewards, generated from both swap fees and burn fees. These fees are collected into a reward pool, which is then distributed by the protocol among XNF stakers. Once the two cycles have elapsed, users have the option to unstake their XNF tokens, regaining complete ownership. At this point, all earned native chain rewards are promptly delivered to the user.

![Grey V4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60996729/235287926-6b18081e-ca41-48c7-8dfc-29cc32c598f1.png)

## ◽️ Claiming Native Token Rewards

Xenify allows users to effortlessly claim and withdraw their accumulated native token rewards at any time. This feature has been designed to simplify reward access and management, demonstrating Xenify's dedication to creating a user-friendly experience that sets it apart from the competition.

![Grey V4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60996729/235287926-6b18081e-ca41-48c7-8dfc-29cc32c598f1.png)

## ◽️ Native Token Reward Distribution

During each cycle, the accumulation of native reward tokens unfolds, wherein the reward pool gradually accumulates tokens collected from burn and swap fees. This will continue to grow with every transaction during the cycle, be it a swap or a burn. 

As the cycle comes to an end, these rewards are carefully allocated among XNF stakers based on the total number of XNF tokens an individual has staked within the protocol. This will encompass both uncollected and staked tokens, ensuring fairness and inclusivity. With this unique reward structure, Xenify is able to strengthen the demand and value for XNF and provide a compelling incentive for holders to actively participate in the protocol. This in turn, encourages long-term engagement while cultivating a growing user base and fortifying the protocol's growth.

![Grey V4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60996729/235287926-6b18081e-ca41-48c7-8dfc-29cc32c598f1.png)

# ◽️ Liquidity Provisioning
![Line Divider - Filled](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60996729/233879462-b465c484-4c2f-4cd2-a126-19529e333d64.png)

<br>

In a strategic effort to ensure sufficient liquidity for all supported chains, Xenify has crafted a unique liquidity provisioning event to coincide with each launch. This forward-thinking initiative has been designed to facilitate the seamless distribution of XNF tokens in alignment with the platform's liquidity needs, effectively catering to the demands of users across every chain.

For this exclusive, one-day event, half of the 20,000 XNF tokens typically reserved for the daily reward cycle distribution will be utilised to bolster the platform's liquidity. The remaining 10,000 XNF tokens will be allocated to individuals who burn vXEN or vUSDy during the one-day event. This offers an unprecedented opportunity to secure a substantial share of the native chain rewards that have accumulated during Day 1 and from swaps executed on Xenify prior to the launch.

By burning vXEN or vUSDy on Day 1, users will not only receive an allotment of XNF tokens at the end of the day, but will also be in line to secure a portion of the native chain rewards (e.g., ETH, BNB, MATIC) distributed at the conclusion of Day 2. With a limited number of XNF holders or stakers on Day 2, only those who engage in the burning of vXEN or vUSDy on Day 1 can reap the benefits of the accrued native chain rewards, collected from swap fees both prior to and during Day 1.

Subsequent to the event, the standard XNF reward distribution cycle will recommence and continue thereafter. This entails XNF stakers receiving a share of the burn and swap fees (based on the fees collected during the previous cycle), while users performing a burn or swap will earn XNF (in accordance with their contributions during each cycle). Through the successful execution of these events on each chain, Xenify aims to secure protocol-owned liquidity across the entire ecosystem, laying the groundwork for sustainable, long-term growth.

![Grey V4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60996729/235287926-6b18081e-ca41-48c7-8dfc-29cc32c598f1.png)

## ◽️ Day 1: Burn and Liquidity Allocation

During the first day of launch, a strategic allocation of 20,000 XNF tokens will take place. Of these tokens, 10,000 XNF tokens are set aside for the establishment of protocol-owned liquidity. The remaining 10,000 XNF tokens are reserved for individuals that burn vXEN or vUSDy, offering users an unique opportunity to actively participate in the token distribution process while securing an allocation of the native chain rewards that have been accumulating.

When Day 1 draws to a close, two significant events take place. First, the 10,000 XNF tokens designated for burns will be distributed among those who burned vXEN or vUSDy. It is important to note that at this stage, there will be a limited number of XNF stakers. Consequently, individuals who opt to burn on Day 1 will be well-positioned to secure an allocation of the accrued native chain rewards distributed on Day 2. 

The second pivotal event involves the protocol generating protocol-owned liquidity. This entails the protocol collecting the sum of all native tokens received from burn fees incurred during Day 1 (when users burn vXEN or vUSDy) and pairing it with the 10,000 XNF tokens allocated specifically for the liquidity provisioning event. The initial price of the XNF token will be set at $1.00, and all associated LP tokens acquired will be retained by Xenify as protocol-owned liquidity.

![Grey V4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60996729/235287926-6b18081e-ca41-48c7-8dfc-29cc32c598f1.png)

## ◽️ Day 2: Return to Normal Distribution

Commencing on Day 2, the protocol will activate its default XNF reward distribution schedule. This involves reserving 10,000 XNF for users who burn vXEN and vUSDy tokens, while an additional 10,000 XNF will be apportioned between swap contributions and contributions from YSL.IO AlphaVaults and MetaVaults.

As Day 2 comes to an end, three crucial events will unfold. Firstly, the protocol will initiate the distribution of the Xenify Airdrop. The 500,000 XNF allocated for the airdrop will be shared among users based on their swap contributions on and before Day 1. The airdrop will be distributed over a period of 365 days, with eligible participants receiving XNF on each new block.

Subsequently, the protocol will disburse 20,000 XNF tokens as part of the regular cycle reward distribution. In this distribution, 10,000 XNF will be allocated to those who performed burns on Day 2, and 10,000 XNF will be apportioned between those who executed eligible swaps on Day 2 and the contributions received from YSL.IO AlphaVaults and MetaVaults.

Lastly, the protocol will distribute the Native Chain Rewards collected from swaps made during Day 1, as well as swaps executed on Xenify prior to the launch, and from yield generated from YSL.IO AlphaVaults and MetaVaults. These rewards will be exclusively distributed to those who have staked XNF, which is only attainable if a user participated in the burning of vXEN and vUSDy on Day 1.

# ◽️ Xenify Airdrop
![Line Divider - Filled](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60996729/233879462-b465c484-4c2f-4cd2-a126-19529e333d64.png)

<br>

To inspire participation and initiate liquidity creation, an exclusive airdrop event of 500,000 XNF tokens will be conducted on each chain where the XNF contract is to be deployed. This airdrop is solely available to those who partake in swaps and pay the accompanying 0.5% swap fee on Xenify on or before Day 1 (prior to the deployment of the XNF contract). Out of this fee, 0.25% is allocated to the team to cover ongoing operational expenses such as platform development, marketing campaigns, and community engagement activities.

The remaining 0.25% will be collected until deployment, and then distributed as part of the first native token reward distribution to users who burn either vXEN or vUSDy tokens during the Liquidity Provisioning Event on Day 1. This distinctive approach not only encourages early user engagement through swap participation for the airdrop but also helps Xenify establish a strong liquidity pool across all supported chains from day one.

The accrued native token rewards generated from swap fees incentivise users to burn vXEN or vUSDy on Day 1, thereby creating protocol-owned liquidity. With 100% of the burn fees being used to create liquidity, a powerful positive feedback loop is formed. As more users swap on Xenify to be part of the airdrop, it entices additional users to burn on Day 1. This leads to an increased amount of burn fees being collected, ultimately resulting in greater liquidity generation.

At the end of Day 2, the protocol will initiate the first distribution of the Xenify Airdrop. This exclusive airdrop will be allocated among eligible participants in proportion to the value of their individual swap contributions relative to the total swap contributions collected during Day 1 and from swaps executed on Xenify before the launch. The 500,000 XNF tokens that make up the airdrop will be distributed by the protocol on each new block over a period of 365 days.

# ◽️ Amplify Burns
![Line Divider - Filled](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60996729/233879462-b465c484-4c2f-4cd2-a126-19529e333d64.png)

Introducing [Phoenix Apes](https://docs.ysl.io/protocol-features/Phoenix-NFT), the exclusive NFT collectible that brings together the Xenify and YSL.IO communities. By owning one of these remarkable NFTs, users of Xenify will unlock an amplified burn effect that effectively doubles the user's batch count when burning vXEN or vUSDy. Remember, the more batches a user burns, the greater the burn fee discount.

Furthermore, holders of the Phoenix NFT will be offered a range of benefits, such as the opportunity to earn USDC rewards every 8 hours and the ability to bypass the Sigma Exit Rate on the YSL.IO protocol. With these added perks, Phoenix Apes heighten user engagement while making significant contributions to the growth of both the Xenify and YSL.IO ecosystems. 

![Grey V4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60996729/235287926-6b18081e-ca41-48c7-8dfc-29cc32c598f1.png)

## ◽️ Limited Collectible

The Phoenix Apes, an exclusive NFT collection developed for YSL.IO, boasts a scarce supply of just 520. Priced at 2,500 USDC, these sought-after NFTs have been ingeniously designed with utility at their core. Not only do they possess distinctive rarities, but they also grant the holder exceptional benefits within the YSL.IO ecosystem.

![Grey V4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60996729/235287926-6b18081e-ca41-48c7-8dfc-29cc32c598f1.png)

## ◽️ Amplified Burn Effect

Phoenix Ape NFT holders unlock an exclusive amplified burn effect when they choose to burn vXEN or vUSDy on Xenify. This unique advantage empowers NFT holders to secure a larger share of the daily distribution of XNF, while also benefiting from significant discounts on their burn fees. By bridging both communities, this exceptional benefit fosters unity and fuels growth for both protocols.

Here's how it works: When Phoenix Ape NFT holders decide to burn vXEN or vUSDy on Xenify, they unlock a daily burn bonus that doubles their batch count (NB). The bonus is capped at 100 daily batches per NFT ID. Once a user uses up all 100 daily bonus batches allocated to their Phoenix Ape NFT, that specific NFT will no longer offer an amplified burn for that day.

Looking for extra firepower? We've got fantastic news! By owning or renting at least 4 of these highly sought-after NFTs, you'll benefit from even greater amplification, with your wallet receiving a daily bonus of 1,000 batches. This effectively replaces the default 100 daily bonus batches reserved for each of your four NFT IDs. In short, if you hold 4 NFTs, your total daily bonus will be capped at 1,000 batches, not 1,400 batches.

Remember, the more batches you burn, the more you save on burn fees. By holding 4 NFTs, you can achieve maximum savings of 50% off your burn fees by burning just 9,000 batches instead of the usual 10,000 required for a 50% discount. Plus, with Phoenix Ape NFTs having a limited supply of 520, there can only be a maximum of 130 wallet addresses that can seize this extra firepower.

And here's the best part: Your daily batch bonus, whether you have one NFT or four NFTs, can be seamlessly bridged to any chain that Xenify launches. Let's say Xenify expands to Polygon and you hold 4 Phoenix Ape NFTs. Once you've exhausted your daily 1,000 batch bonus on the BNB Chain, you can easily bridge the utility of your NFTs to Polygon and enjoy 1,000 bonus batches there. With your multiplier resetting every day, you'll have the opportunity to reap the benefits of this amplified burn effect across all chains Xenify launches on a daily basis!

In summary, holders of Phoenix Ape NFTs not only enjoy an increased share of the daily XNF distribution but also unlock greater discounts on the burn fee by burning a larger amount of batches. The maximum discount is capped at 50% for 10,000 batches, and it's represented by the term (1 - (NB x CS)) in the protocols burn fee formula:

<br>

$$
BF = GS \times (1 - (NB \times CS)) \times NB
$$

**Where:**

- $BF$ - Burn Fee, the fee charged for the burn function, paid in the native token of the blockchain.
- $GS$ - Gas Spent, the total amount of gas consumed by the burn function to execute the code.
- $CS$ - A constant value of 0.00005, used to factor in the discount on the burn fee.
- $NB$ - Number of Batches, the number of batches the user burns, influencing the discount in burn fees as the number of batches increases.

## ◽️ Example: Amplified Burn Effect

Let's take a closer look at how the amplified burn works in different situations:

### ♦️ If you hold between 1 and 3 Phoenix Ape NFTs

  - Each Phoenix Ape NFT is equipped with a daily bonus multiplier limited to 100 batches. When burning a specific number of batches, the protocol first verifies if any of your NFTs possess a bonus balance. If so, the protocol uses your bonus balance to increase your batch count. 

  - For instance, imagine you have a daily bonus of 100 batches on your NFT and opt to burn 10 batches. The protocol will effectively double your batch count to 20 batches, by utilising 10 of your daily bonus batches. Consequently, 10 batches from your NFT ID's daily bonus will be deducted, leaving 90 bonus batches for that NFT on that day.

  - However, if you decide to burn an amount exceeding your bonus balance, the protocol will consume the entire balance of your NFT. For example, if your current daily bonus balance is 90 batches and you choose to burn 5,000 batches, the burn process will count it as 5,090 batches, using up the entire 90 batches from your NFT's bonus balance. As a result, 90 bonus batches allocated to the NFT ID will be removed, leaving zero bonus batches for that NFT on that day. Fear not, your bonus batch count will reset to 100 the following day.

  - Additionally, you have the option to bridge your NFT's utility to another chain where Xenify has launched. By doing so, you can access an extra 100 daily bonus batches on that day, effectively granting you 200 daily bonus batches for your NFT. For example, if you've exhausted your daily bonus on the BNB Chain, simply bridge your NFT's utility to Polygon and receive 1,000 daily bonus batches on Polygon. This process can be repeated for each chain where Xenify has been deployed.

### ♦️ If you hold 4 or more Phoenix Ape NFTs

  - If you own or rent 4 Phoenix Ape NFTs, burning batches becomes even more rewarding. Your wallet will receive a daily bonus of 1,000 batches. This effectively replaces the default 100 daily bonus batches reserved for each of your NFT IDs. In short, if you hold 4 or more NFTs in your wallet, your total daily bonus will be capped at 1,000 batches for that wallet. When you choose to burn a batch amount that is less than your current daily bonus, the protocol will double your batch count by using an equivalent amount. 

  - For instance, if you have 4 NFTs and a daily bonus of 1,000 batches, burning 1 batch will be counted as 2 batches during the burn process. This means that 1 batch will be deducted from your daily NFTs bonus, leaving you with 999 bonus batches for the day on that chain.

  - On the other hand, if you decide to burn a batch amount greater than your current daily bonus, the protocol will utilise your entire bonus balance. Let's say you have 4 NFTs and a daily bonus of 1,000 batches. If you choose to burn the equivalent of 6,000 batches, it will be counted as 7,000 batches during the burn process. The protocol will use your entire daily batch bonus of 1,000 for this. As a result, you won't have any bonus batches remaining to use for that particular day on that chain. But don't worry, once the next day begins, your bonus batch count will reset back to 1,000.

  - Additionally, you can choose to bridge the utility of your 4 NFTs to another chain that Xenify has launched. By doing this, you can use an additional 1,000 daily bonus batches on that day, effectively giving you 2,000 daily bonus batches. For example, if you've used up your daily bonus on the BNB Chain, you can simply bridge your NFTs' utility to Polygon and receive 1,000 daily bonus batches on Polygon. You can repeat this process for each chain where Xenify has been deployed.

## ◽️ Claimable USDC Rewards

The Phoenix NFT has been designed to be a game-changer in the world of NFTs. With its innovative rental mechanism, this unique NFT actively supports the YSL.IO ecosystem and allows users to generate rental income, whilst renters enjoy the advantage of bypassing the protocol’s Sigma Exit Rate.

When a Phoenix Ape NFT is rented through the YSL.IO marketplace, a portion of the user's rental income is collected as tax. Combined with a share of royalty taxes from OpenSea, these earnings are then distributed among all Phoenix Ape NFT holders as USDC rewards on the BNB Chain.

These USDC rewards will be available for holders to claim at the end of each 8-hour epoch. And here's the cherry on top: even if a user decides to bridge their Phoenix NFT from the BNB chain to amplify burns with Xenify on another chain, they'll still be eligible for the USDC distribution.

In simpler terms, the claimable USDC rewards on the BNB Chain will be reserved for all addresses that hold the Phoenix Ape NFT, regardless of whether they bridge utility to another chain.

## ◽️ Bypassing the Sigma Exit Rate
    
The YSL.IO protocol has been purpose-built to provide stability and resilience for all participants. The protocol showcases an innovative Price Stability Model (PSM) that not only aims to stabilise the price of native tokens (YSL, xYSL, bYSL, and USDy), but also guarantees users experience high exit liquidity and preserves the long-term growth of treasury-owned liquidity.

A crucial component of the PSM is the Sigma Exit Rate, which restricts token sales from a wallet by considering the user's acquisition or last sale of the token. However, privileged Phoenix Ape NFT holders can enjoy the freedom to sell up to 100% of their xYSL, bYSL, or USDy tokens without being subjected to the Sigma Exit Rate. This exclusive feature grants users ultimate flexibility and control over their YSL.IO native token holdings.

Xenify places utmost importance on providing an exceptional user experience, with a primary focus on creating a platform that is both intuitive and user-friendly. The onboarding process is designed to be seamless, offering clear instructions and guidance that empower users to effortlessly navigate the platform. 

Setting itself apart from traditional decentralised exchanges, Xenify eliminates the need for users to provide liquidity. Instead, it operates as a cross-chain aggregator, leveraging APIs to obtain the most favourable exchange rates and minimal fees from multiple decentralised exchanges. This approach simplifies the user experience and facilitates seamless single-click transactions across different blockchain networks.

Users can actively engage with Xenify through a range of functions, including token swaps, burning vXEN or vUSDy, staking or unstaking XNF, and claiming rewards. The platform not only delivers a smooth experience for users but also actively rewards them for using the protocol through the daily reward cycle distribution. 

This incentive model ensures that Xenify users are consistently recognised for their participation and encourages continued usage of the platform. Additionally, users can conveniently monitor their staked XNF and accrued rewards, allowing them to easily claim or unstake their XNF tokens with just a few clicks. By adopting this user-centric approach, Xenify remains accessible to both novice and experienced users alike.

# ◽️ Security
![Line Divider - Filled](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60996729/233879462-b465c484-4c2f-4cd2-a126-19529e333d64.png)

<br>

At Xenify, security is paramount to ensuring the utmost safety and reliability of our protocol. Rigorous audits have been conducted on our contracts from DBXen by CertiK, a renowned blockchain security firm. To further fortify our protocol's security, we are planning a re-audit of the contracts by PeckShield, another highly-regarded security company in the industry.

Our platform is thoughtfully designed with decentralisation and autonomy as guiding principles. Xenify's smart contracts are devoid of admin keys, meaning they cannot be upgraded or governed by a centralised authority. This structure reinforces our protocol's truly decentralised and autonomous nature, with decision-making power equitably distributed among participants. As Xenify evolves, we aim to prioritise our users' interests, nurturing transparency and trust throughout the protocol.

Xenify's mission is to forge a transparent, equitable, and user-centric DeFi platform by upholding the First Principles of Crypto in all our endeavours. By committing to these core values, we aspire to establish a protocol that champions trust, fairness, and community-driven growth in the DeFi space.

Instead, Xenify's team will participate alongside the community, fostering a fair and level playing field for all involved.

![Grey V4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60996729/235287926-6b18081e-ca41-48c7-8dfc-29cc32c598f1.png)

## ◽️ Starts at Zero Supply

- XNF will begin with a zero token supply, with tokens minted exclusively through user participation in the ecosystem. This approach guarantees that there is no possibility for a stealth launch, which often favours a select few. Instead, all participants will have equal opportunities to engage with and benefit from the protocol.

![Grey V4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60996729/235287926-6b18081e-ca41-48c7-8dfc-29cc32c598f1.png)

## ◽️ Proof of Participation

- Users will earn rewards proportional to their active engagement and contributions within the ecosystem, fostering a merit-based reward system that promotes fairness and inclusivity for all participants.

![Grey V4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60996729/235287926-6b18081e-ca41-48c7-8dfc-29cc32c598f1.png)

## ◽️ No Investor Allocation

- There will be no token allocation for privileged investors or venture capitalists, ensuring a genuinely equitable distribution of tokens among users actively engaged in the ecosystem. This strategy eliminates preferential treatment and fosters a more inclusive and fair environment for everyone involved.

![Grey V4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60996729/235287926-6b18081e-ca41-48c7-8dfc-29cc32c598f1.png)

## ◽️ Users Mint Their Equity

- XNF tokens will not be pre-mined or allocated to investors or team members. Instead, users can acquire XNF tokens by actively engaging with the protocol, whether by burning vXEN or vUSDy tokens, or swapping tokens from a supported chain. This approach rewards users for their contributions and guarantees a fair distribution of XNF within the ecosystem.

![Grey V4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60996729/235287926-6b18081e-ca41-48c7-8dfc-29cc32c598f1.png)

We understand that you may have questions about Xenify, its features, and its potential. To help you navigate our platform, we've compiled a list of frequently asked questions that provide clarity and insights into Xenify and its ecosystem.

<br>

## ◽️ Does XNF have an initial supply?
- No, Xenify does not have an initial supply, and there is no pre-mine of XNF tokens. Instead, the protocol distributes XNF tokens through a daily reward to users that participate in the ecosystem through direct burns of vXEN and vUSDy or swapping of tokens via the Xenify aggregator. This approach ensures a fair distribution model and encourages active user engagement in the protocol.

![Grey V4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60996729/235287926-6b18081e-ca41-48c7-8dfc-29cc32c598f1.png)

## ◽️ What does the recycle button do?
- The recycle button is an intuitive feature designed with user-centricity at its core. By clicking the recycle button, XNF stakers can instantly convert their accumulated native chain rewards into staked XNF with a single click. The protocol will first sell your accrued native chain rewards, such as ETH, BNB, and MATIC, and use the proceeds to purchase XNF. Subsequently, the newly acquired XNF will be staked on your behalf, streamlining the process for your convenience.

![Grey V4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60996729/235287926-6b18081e-ca41-48c7-8dfc-29cc32c598f1.png)

## ◽️ Why will XNF appreciate in value?
  - The value of XNF holds the potential to appreciate significantly due to Xenify’s innovative tokenomics, thriving ecosystem, and the increasing demand for native chain rewards. With Xenify's cutting-edge cross-chain aggregator, users can enjoy seamless token swapping and engage in various rewarding activities, which drives protocol adoption and ultimately the value of XNF.

  - Additionally, the scarcity of XNF tokens, brought about by halving events, is likely to boost the token's value as more users choose Xenify as their preferred platform for swapping tokens. This will lead to more native chain rewards for XNF stakers, resulting in a growing demand for XNF tokens. Consequently, the token value is poised to rise due to demand, cementing Xenify's position as a promising project within the XEN ecosystem.

![Grey V4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60996729/235287926-6b18081e-ca41-48c7-8dfc-29cc32c598f1.png)

## ◽️ If I make a stake now when can I unstake?
  - Staked XNF tokens are held for two full daily cycles, even during any 'gap cycles'. Once the two full cycles have elapsed, users have the option to unstake their XNF tokens, regaining complete ownership. At this point, all earned native chain rewards are promptly delivered to the user.

![Grey V4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60996729/235287926-6b18081e-ca41-48c7-8dfc-29cc32c598f1.png)

## ◽️ How do I generate rewards with Xenify?
  - Users can generate rewards with Xenify by staking their XNF tokens. In doing so, they will receive native chain tokens such as ETH, BNB, and MATIC on each daily cycle. Each staker will receive a share of the rewards generated from the burn and swap fees collected through the protocol, as well as a share of the yield contributed from the rehypothecation of assets held within YSL.IO AlphaVaults and MetaVaults. This incentive model encourages engagement and contributes to the protocol's long-term growth and sustainability.

![Grey V4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60996729/235287926-6b18081e-ca41-48c7-8dfc-29cc32c598f1.png)

## ◽️ If I make a stake now when will I recieve rewards?
  - Please be aware that when you stake XNF tokens, you will not accumulate rewards within the same cycle in which you make the stake. This approach helps prevent front-running scenarios. Your staked tokens will only begin to accumulate native chain rewards after one reward distribution cycle has elapsed. These rewards are generated from both swap fees and burn fees and are gathered into a reward pool during the cycle. At the conclusion of the cycle, the protocol distributes the rewards among XNF stakers, guaranteeing a fair and transparent allocation.

![Grey V4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60996729/235287926-6b18081e-ca41-48c7-8dfc-29cc32c598f1.png)

## ◽️ Are there different ways to participate with Xenify?
- Yes, there are several ways to participate with Xenify, including:

  - Engaging in direct burns of vXEN or vUSDy to acquire XNF.
  - Purchasing a Phoenix Ape NFT to unlock amplified burns.
  - Contributing to the protocol's growth through community initiatives.
  - Staking XNF tokens to earn native chain rewards such as ETH, BNB and MATIC.
  - Using the Xenify aggregator to perform seamless single-click swaps and earning XNF in the process.

![Grey V4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60996729/235287926-6b18081e-ca41-48c7-8dfc-29cc32c598f1.png)

## ◽️ What would be the scenario if, throughout the course of a daily cycle, there are no instances of users performing either token swapping or burning activities?

- In the event that no swaps have taken place on Xenify and no users have burned either vXEN or vUSDy, the protocol will not carry out the daily XNF cycle distribution. During that cycle, the XNF tokens scheduled for distribution will simply not be minted. Consequently, the total supply of XNF will decrease by the amount that was intended to be distributed in that cycle. 

- For example, if the daily allocation for a cycle was 20,000 XNF, with half allocated for burning activities and the other half reserved for those who perform swaps on Xenify, if no swaps or burns occur during that cycle, the 20,000 XNF will not be minted or distributed. Instead, the total supply of XNF will be reduced by 20,000 XNF when the cycle concludes.

## ◽️ Tokenomics

  - Tokenomics is the study of the economic aspects of a cryptocurrency or token, such as supply, distribution, and incentives.

![Grey V4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60996729/235287926-6b18081e-ca41-48c7-8dfc-29cc32c598f1.png)

## ◽️ Direct Burns 

  - When a token is burned it's usually sent to an inactive address and removed from circulation, effectively reducing the total supply by the amount burned. On Xenify, Direct Burns happen when users purposefully burn tokens (vXEN or vUSDy) to promote the growth of the protocol.  As a reward for their commitment to the protocol, users receive XNF tokens in exchange for their burned vXEN or vUSDy tokens.

![Grey V4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60996729/235287926-6b18081e-ca41-48c7-8dfc-29cc32c598f1.png)

## ◽️ Proof of Burn

  - Proof of Burn is a commitment mechanism where users burn tokens to show their support for the protocol. In exchange, they receive equity.
