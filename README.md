Welcome to Xenify! Our groundbreaking protocol synergistically blends DBXen’s innovative tokenomics and ChainZap’s powerful functionality into one powerful package, setting the stage for a seismic shift in the DeFi landscape. With a maximum total supply of only 21,600,000 XNF tokens, Xenify empowers users to earn XNF while simultaneously functioning as a first-layer burner for the XEN token. Our overarching mission? To revolutionise the DeFi space with a seamless, ultra-efficient cross-chain swapping experience that lavishes users with Native Chain Rewards and a token with a finite supply.

At the core of Xenify's bold vision is ChainZap, a cutting-edge liquidity aggregation protocol that streamlines cross-chain token swaps. Whether you want to swap tokens on Ethereum, BNB Chain, Polygon, Arbitrum, or any of the 36 supported chains, Xenify has you covered. With access to 19 different aggregators, Xenify guarantees unparalleled liquidity and optimal rates for your swaps. By leveraging cutting-edge APIs, Xenify bridges seamless communication with a wide array of DEX aggregators, dramatically enhancing the swapping experience and streamlining the quest for optimal swap routes across the vast tapestry of chains.

With Xenify's built-in swap and burn fee mechanisms, a reciprocal environment that benefits all participants is established. Wherein XNF stakers are generously rewarded with an impressive 100% of swap fees and burn fees as Native Chain Rewards across all supported chains. That's right, stakers earn from every swap and burn!

What's more, Xenify's innovative design has enabled the seamless integration of the YSL.IO protocol, incorporating its state-of-the-art AlphaVaults and MetaVaults into the daily reward distribution process. Thanks to this integration, an incredible 100% of yields obtained from the rehypothecation of vault assets are directed straight to Xenify, fuelling development and rewarding XNF stakers. In return, YSL.IO acquires an XNF position and channels 100% of the Native Chain Rewards it earns to vault participants. This win-win strategy guarantees a continuous flow of Native Chain Rewards for XNF stakers and ensures Xenify's expansion, even without swaps or burns. As a result, long-term user engagement is fostered for both Xenify and YSL.IO, and rewards are boosted for those who are truly dedicated to each protocol.

At the heart of Xenify's ethos is a steadfast commitment to fairness and transparency, embodied by our exemplary token distribution model. There will be no team, founder, or investor allocation. In fact, the only way to mint XNF tokens is through active participation in the ecosystem - by either burning or swapping tokens. This approach certifies a genuinely equitable distribution of XNF tokens, rewarding users for their contributions and fostering a truly community-driven protocol.

As we bring together the cutting-edge liquidity aggregation of ChainZap and our own distinctive tokenomics, Xenify is poised to redefine the landscape of cross-chain swapping, all while nurturing a thriving ecosystem that places utmost importance on user satisfaction and sustainable growth. Join us as we take a leap into the future, and experience the world of Xenify - a realm where innovation meets reward, where community powers expansion, and where the foundation for DeFi's bright tomorrow is being laid. Welcome to the revolution!

![Grey V4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60996729/235287926-6b18081e-ca41-48c7-8dfc-29cc32c598f1.png)

## ♦️ Staking

- Xenify integrates a dynamic staking rewards mechanism that offers significant benefits to XNF stakers. By staking XNF tokens, users become eligible to receive a resounding 100% of burn fees and swap fees generated on supported chains as Native Chain Rewards. But that’s not all! Owing to Xenify's seamless integration with the YSL.IO protocol, an additional layer of rewards is offered to XNF stakers. Within this framework, a full 100% of the yield generated from the rehypothecation of YSL.IO AlphaVault and MetaVault assets are redirected to Xenify and shared amongst XNF stakers. This equitable incentive model ensures that active participants in the ecosystem are amply rewarded, helping us foster a vibrant and engaged community.

![Grey V4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60996729/235287926-6b18081e-ca41-48c7-8dfc-29cc32c598f1.png)

## ♦️ Token Burning

- If users want to acquire XNF tokens, they can do so by burning vXEN and vUSDy tokens. Think of vXEN and vUSDy as virtual counterparts of XEN and USDy, respectively. These tokens have been designed exclusively for the purpose of converting into XNF. 

- To get your hands on vXEN, you'll need XEN tokens or a version of the XEN token supported by Xenify. For example, if you have bXEN (the XEN token residing on the BNB Chain), you can easily convert it into vXEN. And once you have vXEN, you can burn it to participate in Xenify’s daily distribution of XNF tokens. Both the bXEN and vXEN you provide are burned by the protocol, removing them from circulation. It's as straightforward as that. Keep in mind that the conversion rate will be fixed but may vary based on the version of the XEN token you're exchanging.

- Similarly, if you're interested in obtaining vUSDy, you'll need to possess YSL.IO native tokens like bYSL, xYSL, or USDy. For example, if you have bYSL, you can easily convert it into vUSDy. And once you have vUSDy, you can burn it to participate in Xenify’s daily distribution of XNF tokens. Both the bYSL and vUSDy you provide are burned by the protocol, removing them from circulation. Just like with vXEN, the conversion rate for vUSDy is fixed, but it depends on the specific YSL.IO native token you're exchanging.

- Now, you may be wondering why we've integrated the burning of XEN and USDy tokens. Well, it's not just a smart move to reduce the circulating supply of both these tokens; it's also a powerful way to connect our communities. We want to strengthen both the XEN and YSL.IO ecosystems while strategically unifying our communities under a shared vision.

## ♦️ Cross-Chain Swapping

- Xenify's integration with ChainZap enables users to execute seamless cross-chain swaps, making it easier than ever to exchange tokens across different chains. Our streamlined process offers a new level of simplicity in cross-chain token swaps and provides access to the most competitive rates available, while delivering an efficient and user-friendly DeFi experience like never before.

## ♦️ Fair Equity Distribution

- Xenify is dedicated to promoting fairness and transparency in the distribution of equity among its users. Our unique tokenomics and staking model are designed to reward active participants and long-term holders, creating a strong incentive for users to contribute to the growth of our ecosystem. As our community continues to grow, the equitable distribution of rewards and XNF tokens ensures that everyone benefits, promoting a vibrant and engaged community.

# ◽️ XEN Overview 
![Line Divider - Filled](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60996729/233879462-b465c484-4c2f-4cd2-a126-19529e333d64.png)

<br>

XEN is a project that was launched on the principles of self-custody, trustless consensus, and decentralisation. It is a joint effort of several blockchain enthusiasts who aim to create a fairer, more transparent mining ecosystem.

One of the main goals of XEN is to democratise mining by providing a decentralised platform that allows anyone to participate in the mining process. This is achieved by utilising a Proof-of-Work (PoW) consensus algorithm that is resistant to ASIC mining, thus ensuring that the network remains accessible to individual miners.

In addition to its mining capabilities, XEN also features a native cryptocurrency, the XEN token, which is used to incentivise miners and maintain the security of the network. XEN tokens are also used to pay for transaction fees and other network services.

XEN operates on a Proof of Participation (PoP) system, which allows participants to mint their coins. The XEN smart contract employs a fair distribution system based on reward time locks and the total number of participants. XEN's value is linked to its difficulty to be minted, similar to Bitcoin. As more participants join and mint XEN, the total amount of generated XEN drops, making it more scarce and valuable.

One of the key features of XEN is its simplicity, as it is based on the ERC20 token standard with minimal code, no pre-minting, hidden doors, admin keys, or origin wallets. Furthermore, XEN has a supply of zero and can only be minted by the participating community. This makes it inflationary at the beginning and disinflationary as adoption increases. XEN is immutable and has no backing by investors or intrinsic value.

To mint XEN, participants can connect their Ethereum-compatible wallets to the XEN smart contract and specify the number of days they are willing to wait to receive XEN. The smart contract generates a XEN rank (cRANK) based on how many people interacted with the contract before the participant. Participants can also stake XEN for 1 to 1,000 days, with APY rewards starting at 20% on XEN Genesis and decreasing by 1 percentage point every 90 days until it reaches 2%, where it will remain indefinitely.

Overall, XEN represents an innovative approach to mining that emphasises decentralisation, accessibility, and sustainability. XEN's combination of features, simplicity and fairness make it a unique and promising project in the crypto space.

![Grey V4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60996729/235287926-6b18081e-ca41-48c7-8dfc-29cc32c598f1.png)

## ♦️ Unifying the Chains (vXEN)

Introducing vXEN, a groundbreaking solution by Xenify that enables seamless burning of XEN across all chains, unifying the XEN ecosystem and supporting its deflationary nature. This innovative approach has been made possible through the integration of Alexar, a decentralised protocol that breaks down barriers between cross-chain communication with its comprehensive protocol suite.

Thanks to vXEN, you don't need to have native XEN tokens on the Ethereum network to take part in Xenify's burn process and get your hands on XNF. Instead, Xenify makes it easy for users in the broader XEN community to acquire XNF by simply burning their native XEN tokens from various EVM-compatible networks, right from their wallets.

This innovative approach stems from Xenify's shared commitment to the interoperability of the XEN ecosystem and the vision of making Xenify accessible to XEN holders on multiple chains. As a result, vXEN enables Xenify to seamlessly interact with any chain supported by the XEN ecosystem, positioning itself as a strategic layer 2 burner of XEN.

vXEN can be thought of as the virtual counterpart of XEN tokens, designed specifically to simplify the process of converting various versions of XEN tokens into XNF tokens. It's important to note that you'll need XEN tokens or a XEN token variant supported by Xenify, like bXEN on the BNB Chain, to obtain vXEN. Once you have vXEN, you can burn it to join Xenify's daily distribution of XNF tokens.

And here's the best part: Xenify has implemented a fixed conversion rate for each XEN variant. With these predetermined rates, you can always be confident about the number of batches your native XEN tokens will produce during the burning process. This simplifies the entire process and eliminates the need for continuous calculations of XEN per batch. However, keep in mind that while the conversion rate for vXEN remains fixed, it will vary depending on the specific version of the XEN token you choose to exchange. Please refer to the table below for details:

<br>

| Network     | Native Token     | Conversion Rate       |
|-------------|------------------|-----------------------|
| Ethereum    | XEN              | 1 vXEN = 1 XEN        |
| Avalanche   | aXEN             | 1 vXEN = 67 aXEN      |
| BNB Chain   | bXEN             | 1 vXEN = 108 bXEN     |
| Polygon     | mXEN             | 1 vXEN = 144 mXEN     |
| MoonBeam    | mbXEN            | 1 vXEN = 372 mbXEN    |
| Fantom      | fmXEN            | 1 vXEN = 529 fmXEN    |
| OKX         | okXEN            | 1 vXEN = 1380 okXEN   |
| Evmos       | coXEN            | 1 vXEN = 3349 coXEN   |

# ◽️ USDy Overview 
![Line Divider - Filled](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60996729/233879462-b465c484-4c2f-4cd2-a126-19529e333d64.png)

USDy is a reward token that incentivizes participation in the YSL.IO ecosystem with stability and sustainability at its core. Developed with cutting-edge tokenomincs, the YSL.IO protocol boasts a host of innovative features that make USDy a standout reward token in the DeFi landscape.

One of the key highlights of USDy is its Price Stability Model (PSM), which ensures a continuous increase in liquidity, even in the face of sell pressure. The protocol achieves this through a combination of autonomous Treasury-Owned Liquidity creation and an ingenious Buyback and Burn feature (UBB), which actively works to stabilise the price of USDy.

Here's how it works: the UBB is activated every 4-epochs if the USDy pool price falls below $0.95. During this time, a portion of the tax from every trade of YSL, xYSL, bYSL, and USDy will be used to purchase and/or burn USDy. Additionally, 15% of every HydraVault deposit will also be used to purchase and burn USDy.

What's more, the protocol generates Treasury-Owned Liquidity for USDy at every point of user interaction, ensuring that as more users join the YSL.IO ecosystem, USDy's liquidity grows autonomously. And to further reduce the supply of USDy and increase its price, the Incentive Buyback mechanism (UIB) kicks in every time someone purchases the YSL token using ChainZap. This mechanism incorporates a 25% incentive to purchase YSL while actively reducing the supply of USDy.

Here's how it works: all of the USDC sent will be used to purchase and burn USDy equivalent to 175%, and as a bonus, users receive a complimentary 25% USDy for each purchase. The result is a reduction in USDy supply and an increase in its price, benefiting USDy holders.

In conclusion, USDy has been carefully crafted by YSL.IO with a focus on price stability, and liquidity growth. With innovative features like UBB and UIB, USDy liquidity will continue to grow autonomously while its price remains stable, creating a sustainable, less volatile, and more robust ecosystem.

## ♦️ Unifying the YSL.IO Ecosystem (vUSDy)

Introducing vUSDy, another groundbreaking solution by Xenify that enables seamless burning of YSL.IO native tokens, thereby unifying the YSL.IO ecosystem and supporting the protocol's cutting-edge Price Stability Model for its native tokens. 

This innovative approach to token burning has been made possible through the integration of Alexar, a decentralised protocol that breaks down barriers between cross-chain communication with its comprehensive protocol suite.

Similar to vXEN, users are not obligated to possess the native XEN token on the Ethereum network in order to participate in Xenify's burn process and acquire XNF. Instead, Xenify empowers users within the YSL.IO ecosystem to effortlessly burn their YSL.IO native tokens directly from their wallets and acquire XNF.

This solution truly reflects Xenify's dedication to interoperability, by expanding the protocol's scope and unlocking endless possibilities through the strategic unification of the XEN and YSL.IO ecosystems, fostering a shared vision that brings both communities together.

vUSDy can be regarded as the virtual counterpart of YSL.IO's reward token, known as USDy. The sole purpose of vUSDy is to facilitate the conversion of YSL.IO native token variants into XNF tokens. It's important to note that acquiring vUSDy requires USDy tokens or a YSL.IO token variant supported by Xenify, such as bYSL or xYSL.

Once you possess vUSDy, you can burn it to participate in Xenify's daily distribution of XNF tokens. With each YSL.IO token variant having a fixed conversion rate, it eliminates the guesswork from determining how much XEN you're required to burn as a batch. In other words, users can always have confidence in the amount of vUSDy they will obtain when burning their YSL.IO native tokens. Please bear in mind that although the conversion rate for vUSDy remains fixed, it will vary depending on the specific YSL.IO native token you choose to exchange, as outlined in the table below:

<br>

| Native Token        | Conversion Rate      |
|---------------------|----------------------|
| USDy                | 1 USDy = 1 vUSDy     |
| bYSL                | 1 bYSL = 5 vUSDy     |
| xYSL                | 1 xYSL = 120 vUSDy   |

Introducing Xenify, not just an aggregator of aggregators, but a cross-chain aggregator of aggregators! Expertly designed to streamline the swapping process for users traversing multiple chains, Xenify's capabilities are genuinely unparalleled. Powered by ChainZap, an advanced liquidity aggregation protocol, Xenify connects to 19 different aggregators, delivering exceptional liquidity and unbeatable rates across 32 leading chains. Swapping tokens between Ethereum, BNB Chain, Polygon, and many more has never been more effortless.

Imagine this scenario: a user wishes to swap Token-A on Ethereum for Token-B on BNB Chain. With Xenify, the swap is executed with a single click and a single transaction on Ethereum. No more complicated chain navigation or price hunting – Xenify takes care of everything, providing the best available rates.

But wait, there's more! Xenify is not merely a platform for cross-chain swaps; it's a carefully designed ecosystem with distinctive tokenomics, employing swap and burn fee mechanisms to benefit all participants. The optional 0.5% swap fee, which users can elect to pay when executing a swap, not only allows them to earn XNF based on their fee contribution but also rewards XNF stakers with native chain tokens. It's a true win-win!

Here's how it works: When users opt to pay the swap fee, they not only facilitate their transactions but also secure a position in the daily XNF reward cycle. 100% of the 0.5% swap fee will be distributed as native chain rewards to staked XNF holders on supported chains at the end of the daily cycle. That's right – XNF stakers can reap the benefits from every swap on supported chains each and every day!

Furthermore, Xenify's design incorporates an ingenious burn mechanism that enables users to burn XEN and USDy tokens to mint XNF, positioning the XEN burning process as a strategic layer 2 burner of XEN. But here's the best part: a staggering 100% of burn fees are channelled back to XNF stakers.

Xenify's built-in swap and burn fee mechanisms help create a reciprocal environment that rewards platform users with XNF as part of the daily reward cycle, and XNF stakers with a generous 100% of burn fees and swap fees across all supported chains. The team's portion of the swap fee is instrumental in promoting and enhancing the Xenify platform and its associated tokens (XEN, USDy, and XNF), ensuring increased awareness and adoption. This strategy not only fosters user engagement but also amplifies rewards for those deeply involved with the protocol.

In addition to the swap and burn fees, XNF stakers will also benefit from Xenify's strategic integration of the YSL.IO protocol. This secondary layer of Xenify's framework rewards XNF stakers from the yield derived from the rehypothecation of assets deposited in YSL.IO’s state-of-the-art AlphaVaults and MetaVaults, ensuring that even if there are no swaps or burns performed on the platform, XNF stakers still receive Native Chain Rewards. This innovative approach to staking and rewards, paired with Xenify's unique tokenomics model, guarantees that the platform will remain ahead of the curve, attract a growing user base, and contribute to the project's overall success.

In summary, Xenify is the ultimate cross-chain aggregator of aggregators that provides users with unparalleled simplicity and efficiency when swapping tokens across 32 leading chains. With a thoughtfully designed ecosystem, Xenify's unique tokenomics model benefits all participants, from platform users to XNF stakers. Xenify truly offers the best of both worlds: effortless cross-chain token swapping and significant earning potential. Whether executing cross-chain token swaps or burning tokens to mint XNF, every action taken on the Xenify platform contributes to a reciprocal environment of rewards and engagement. With Xenify, users can experience the best rates, earn XNF, and be part of a vibrant community - making it the go-to choice for anyone looking to simplify the cross-chain swapping process while maximising their earning potential.

# ◽️ Xenify Tokenomics
![Line Divider - Filled](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60996729/233879462-b465c484-4c2f-4cd2-a126-19529e333d64.png)

Xenifiy is a groundbreaking protocol that champions fairness, sustainability, and user engagement. At the heart of its tokenomics structure lies XNF, the platform's native token. XNF serves as the primary incentive for users, with a limited supply of 21.6 million. By engaging in a multitude of protocol activities such as burning, staking and swapping tokens, users are rewarded, fostering a dynamic ecosystem where benefits accrue based on contributions and involvement. With this thoughtful design, Xenify guarantees a level playing field for all users, creating an environment where everyone can reap the rewards and laying the foundation for an equitable, community-driven platform.

![Grey V4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60996729/235287926-6b18081e-ca41-48c7-8dfc-29cc32c598f1.png)

## ◽️ Token Supply

XNF is the lifeblood of the Xenify protocol, and features a limited total supply of 21.6 million tokens. The distribution process for XNF is designed with transparency and equity in mind, ensuring a level playing field for all. 

With no pre-mines, investor allocations, founder allocations, or team allocations, the Xenify protocol fosters an environment of fairness and inclusivity. Users have the opportunity to earn XNF equity by engaging in various activities, such as burning vXEN or vUSDy tokens and swapping tokens across supported chains. This unique token supply model not only promotes active participation but also cultivates a thriving, community-focused ecosystem that everyone can be a part of.

## ◽️ Supply Distribution

Xenify's total supply of XNF tokens is capped at 21.6 million, and strategically divided into three core segments. The allocation comprises 10,500,000 XNF tokens designated for direct burns of vXEN and vUSDy, an additional 10,500,000 XNF tokens reserved for swap volume, 100,000 XNF set aside for the vXEN Protocol Fee Manager for XNF liquidity creation, and a separate 500,000 XNF tokens earmarked for the Genesis Airdrop.

Drawing inspiration from Bitcoin, Xenify's distribution model adopts the halving principle.  As demonstrated in the graph below, following the 7th halving, Xenify's daily distribution rate stabilises, ensuring a consistent output of 156.25 XNF tokens per day until the maximum supply is reached in month 2112.

With Xenify's halving model applying equally to both direct burns and swap volume distributions, it guarantees a fair distribution of the daily reward pool among active users. This can be in the form of burning tokens to acquire XNF or by utilising Xenify on supported chains to execute swaps. This distinctive strategy has been thoughtfully engineered to ensure an equitable supply distribution centred around users' active participation, underscoring Xenify's steadfast dedication to fostering an equitable and engaged community.

## ◽️ XNF Minting Process and Incentives

The minting process for XNF has been meticulously designed to reward users who actively contribute to Xenify's growth through various activities. This approach promotes an equitable distribution of XNF tokens, cultivating a truly decentralised and community-driven protocol.

Likewise, Xenify's incentive structure has been carefully crafted to motivate users to actively participate in the protocol's growth. Users who engage more with the platform receive a proportionate share of the newly minted XNF tokens, fuelling further involvement.

XNF tokens are distributed in one-day cycles, with the reward pool commencing at 20,000 XNF tokens. This initial allocation is divided into two categories: 50% is designated for users who burn vXEN or vUSDy tokens, while the remaining 50% is apportioned between contributions through the platform's 0.5% swap fee and contributions obtained from the yield generated from the rehypothecation of YSL.IO AlphaVault and MetaVault assets.

With the halving model in place, the daily reward pool diminishes over time and ultimately leads to the complete distribution of the 21.6 million XNF tokens at month 2112. Users that stake XNF tokens will accumulate native token rewards that are generated on the Xenify platform from swap fees and burn fees (e.g., ETH, BNB, MATIC).

Additionally, XNF stakers will benefit from Xenify's strategic integration of the YSL.IO protocol, with 100% of the yield generated from the rehypothecation of assets deposited in YSL.IO AlphaVaults and MetaVaults being routed to Xenify to reward XNF stakers.

This innovative three-pronged incentive model not only helps generate swap volume with users seeking to earn XNF but also rewards user participation through burning and staking. Ultimately, this approach fosters platform growth and cultivates a thriving, engaged user base.

![Grey V4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60996729/235287926-6b18081e-ca41-48c7-8dfc-29cc32c598f1.png)

## ♦️ Burn to earn XNF 
  - The Xenify platform empowers its users by providing the ability to burn vXEN and vUSDy tokens, resulting in the minting of XNF. vXEN and vUSDy are virtual counterparts of XEN and USDy tokens, respectively. Their sole purpose is to facilitate the conversion into XNF tokens. 

  - It's important to note that acquiring vXEN requires XEN tokens or a XEN token variant supported by Xenify, such as bXEN on the BNB Chain. Once you possess vXEN, you can burn it to participate in Xenify's daily distribution of XNF tokens. During this burn process, both the XEN token variant and vXEN provided are permanently removed from circulation. Please bear in mind that the amount of vXEN remains you obtain from the burn process will vary depending on the current market value of the specific XEN token variant you choose to burn.

  - Similarly, users interested in obtaining vUSDy will need YSL.IO native tokens like bYSL, xYSL, or USDy. Once you have acquired vUSDy, you can take part in Xenify's daily distribution of XNF tokens by burning it. During this burn process, both the YSL.IO token variant and vUSDy provided are permanently removed from circulation. It is worth noting that the conversion rate for vUSDy remains fixed, but it depends on the specific YSL.IO native token you opt to exchange.

  - Xenify distinguishes itself by integrating this unique burn mechanism, positioning the protocol as a key player in the strategic layer 1 burning of XEN tokens. This strategic approach extends beyond simply reducing the circulating supply of XEN and USDy tokens. Xenify aspires to unify the XEN and YSL.IO ecosystems, fostering a shared vision that brings both communities together.

![Grey V4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60996729/235287926-6b18081e-ca41-48c7-8dfc-29cc32c598f1.png)

## ♦️ Swap to earn XNF 
  - Xenify is a pioneering cross-chain aggregator of aggregators that transforms the way users experience token exchanges.  With its seamless single-click transactions and the opportunity to earn XNF tokens, Xenify sets itself apart from the competition.

  - By swapping tokens on Xenify and opting to pay the swap fee, users actively contribute to the platform's growth. The entire 0.5% swap fee is distributed as rewards to XNF stakers, empowering those who actively engage with the protocol.

  - However, what truly sets Xenify apart is the remarkable value our users receive by opting to pay the swap fee. When users pay the optional swap fee, they can boost their XNF holdings through daily XNF token distributions, making Xenify a truly rewarding experience. Not only do users enjoy a seamless cross-chain token-swapping experience, but they also earn XNF tokens along the way. 

  - These XNF rewards are automatically staked, enabling users to earn native chain tokens on a daily basis (such as BNB, ETH & MATIC). These native chain rewards are generated through the protocol’s swap fees, burn fees, and reypothecation of assets held by YSL.IO’s AlphaVaults and MetaVaults. As a result, users benefit from the efficiency and competitive rates offered by Xenify while earning rewards and actively participating in shaping the future of Xenify's dynamic ecosystem.

![Grey V4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60996729/235287926-6b18081e-ca41-48c7-8dfc-29cc32c598f1.png)

## ♦️ Stake XNF to earn native tokens 
  - Distinguishing itself from generic aggregators, Xenify takes pride in its innovative staking model that incorporates a burn fee and swap fee distribution mechanism, as well as a secondary layer involving the YSL.IO protocol. This unique approach empowers platform users to execute seamless swaps and embark on a rewarding journey by staking the XNF tokens acquired from daily distributions.

  - XNF token stakers play an essential role in Xenify's long-term growth, and in return reap the benefits of a proportionate share of burn and swap fees generated across all supported chains. As Xenify continues to broaden its reach, an increasing amount of swap volume is guaranteed, with users eager to benefit from a seamless swapping experience while earning XNF on every swap they make. This, in turn, leads to increased Native Chain Rewards for XNF stakers! This equitable model establishes a positive feedback loop, guaranteeing that all participants can benefit from the ecosystem's growth in proportion to their engagement.

  - But that's not all! XNF stakers will also benefit from Xenify's strategic integration of the YSL.IO protocol. This secondary layer of Xenify's framework rewards XNF stakers from the yield derived from the rehypothecation of YSL.IO AlphaVault and MetaVault assets, ensuring that even if there are no swaps or burns performed on the platform, XNF stakers still receive Native Chain Rewards.

  - Here's how it works: every day, the protocol distributes 100% of burn fees (originating from direct burns of XEN or USDy), 100% of YSL.IO AlphaVault and MetaVault yields, and 100% of the platform's swap fees (generated on supported chains) to XNF stakers. These rewards are allocated in the form of native chain tokens—a highly liquid asset—signalling a potentially lucrative return for users staking XNF.

  - Xenify's innovative staking model enables users to stake their XNF tokens for an opportunity to receive a steady stream of exceptional rewards in the form of Native Chain Rewards. This distinctive rewards distribution model not only strengthens the demand and value for XNF but also serves as an added incentive for holders to stake their daily distribution of XNF. This strategy has been integrated to encourage long-term engagement with the protocol while cultivating a growing user base.


![Grey V4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60996729/235287926-6b18081e-ca41-48c7-8dfc-29cc32c598f1.png)

## ◽️ Costs of Swapping on Xenify

Xenify offers a ground-breaking token swap solution that not only simplifies cross-chain transactions but also rewards its platform users, all the while nurturing the expansion of its ecosystem. By implementing an optional 0.5% fee on every token swap, Xenify accomplishes three essential objectives: rewarding Xenify platform users, providing native chain rewards to XNF stakers, and encouraging continuous engagement with the protocol.

Here's the process: When a user initiates a token swap on Xenify, they have the option to pay a 0.5% swap fee. This fee is strategically allocated to promote future growth and incentivise user participation, with 100% being distributed to XNF stakers in the form of native chain tokens.

By opting to pay the nominal 0.5% swap fee, users not only expedite their transactions but also secure a spot in the daily XNF reward cycle. These XNF rewards are automatically staked on the users' behalf to unlock even greater gains from the native tokens distributed at the conclusion of each daily cycle. As a result, users enjoy the advantages of Xenify's efficiency and competitive rates, all while reaping rewards and actively shaping the evolution of Xenify's dynamic ecosystem.

![Grey V4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60996729/235287926-6b18081e-ca41-48c7-8dfc-29cc32c598f1.png)

## ◽️ Costs of Burning on Xenify

The Xenify protocol enables users to burn vXEN or vUSDy tokens to secure XNF from the daily XNF reward cycle. Think of vXEN and vUSDy as virtual counterparts of XEN and USDy, respectively. These tokens have been specifically created for seamless conversion into XNF.

By participating in the burn process to acquire vXEN and vUSDy, users will encounter certain costs such as transaction gas fees and the mandatory protocol fee and burn fee. However, the protocol fee and burn fee calculations have been carefully designed to not only ensure a transparent and consistent method for token burning but also reward users with attractive discounts on their burn fees of up to 75%.

To obtain vXEN, you simply need to hold a supported XEN token variant and a sufficient amount of native chain tokens to cover the mandatory protocol fee and burn fee. 100% of the XEN token variant you provide will be burned, ensuring your wallet address is included in the burn record for the distribution of X1 - the native token of the new XEN Layer 1 (X1 Chain). 

100% of the native chain tokens collected from the protocol fee will be sent to the vXEN Protocol Fee Manager, where they will be redeployed to support the ecosystem. Whereby, 50% of the fee creates XNF liquidity and the remaining 50% creates XEN native token liquidity.

Just bear in mind that the value of vXEN is fixed at $1.00, with 1 vXEN equal to $1.00 XEN (and XEN token variant) based on its current market value. This means that the required amount for each burn is tailored to the current market value of the specific XEN token variant you're burning, ensuring a fair exchange for all users. For instance, if the current price of bXEN is $0.01, and you hold 10,000 bXEN, the protocol will determine your 10,000 bXEN as equivalent to $100 vXEN (100 vXEN tokens).

  - For example, if you hold 10,000 bXEN, you can easily convert it into vXEN by providing a protocol fee and burn fee. This protocol fee is determined based on the current market price of your XEN token variant. If the current price of bXEN is $0.01, and you hold 10,000 bXEN, this means your bXEN is equivalent to $100, so you will need to provide $100 BNB for the protocol fee. If you decide to proceed, you will also need to provide a burn fee to execute the burn function (let's say the protocol determines your burn fee to be $20 BNB). Once you execute the burn process, you'll obtain $200 vXEN in return (based on your $100 bXEN and $100 BNB protocol fee). Once you have vXEN, you can burn it to participate in Xenify's daily distribution of XNF tokens (no burn fee will be collected when you burn vXEN). Both the $100 bXEN and $200 vXEN you sent during the burn process will be permanently removed from circulation, the $100 BNB protocol fee will be sent to the vXEN Protocol Fee Manager, and the $20 BNB burn fee will be distributed among XNF stakers at the end of the cycle as native chain rewards.

Similarly, if you want to acquire vUSDy, you'll need to have YSL.IO native tokens such as bYSL, xYSL, or USDy. Keep in mind that when you burn for vUSDy, the protocol will use predetermined rates to convert bYSL, xYSL, and USDy. Also, like acquiring vXEN, when you burn USDy for vUSDy, you will need to pay a protocol fee of an equivalent value. However, this protocol fee will not apply when you burn xYSL or bYSL. 100% of the native chain tokens acquired from the protocol fee will be sent to the vUSDy Protocol Fee Manager, where it will be split 50:50 and used to create XNF liquidity (50%), as well as USDy treasury-owned liquidity (50%).

  - For example, if you hold 100 USDy tokens, you can easily convert them into vUSDy by holding native chain tokens to cover the protocol fee and burn fee. The protocol fee will be determined as $100 BNB, based on the protocol's fixed conversion rate of $1.00 per USDy. If you decide to proceed, you will need to provide a burn fee to execute the burn function (let's say the protocol determines your burn fee to be $20 BNB). Once you execute the burn process, the protocol will mint vUSDy based on the total value of your USDy and protocol fee. As a result, you'll obtain $200 vUSDy in return (based on your 100 USDy and the $100 BNB protocol fee). Once you have vUSDy, you can burn it to participate in Xenify's daily distribution of XNF tokens (no burn fee will be collected when you burn vUSDy). Both the 100 USDy and 200 vUSDy you sent during the burn process will be permanently removed from circulation, the $100 BNB protocol fee will be sent to the vUSDy Protocol Fee Manager, and the $20 BNB burn fee will be distributed among XNF stakers at the end of the cycle as native chain rewards.

The burn fee calculation is designed to consider various factors, including the timing of the burn during a cycle, the number of batches being burned, and their associated value. The best part? The more batches a user burns, the greater the discount they'll enjoy, with potential savings of up to 75% off for 10,000 batches during the first hour of every cycle. This creates an attractive incentive for users to undertake larger burn operations at earlier points in a cycle. 

The burn fee is determined using this formula:

<br>

$$
BF = (GC \times VB) \times (1 - (NB \times CS))
$$

**Where:**

- $BF$ (Burn Fee) - The fee charged for the burn function, paid in the native token of the blockchain.
- $GC$ (Gas Coefficient) - A time-weighted coefficient used to determine the value of gas required for the burn function to execute the transaction.
- $VB$ (Value of Batches) - The dollar value of batches being burned by the user.
- $CS$ (Discount Coefficient) - A time-weighted coefficient used to factor in the discount on the burn fee.
- $NB$ (Number of Batches) - The number of batches the user burns, influencing the discount in burn fees as the number of batches increases. This will be capped at 10,000 batches.

<br>

But what exactly is a batch? A batch represents a fixed number of tokens, either vXEN or vUSDy, required to participate in the burn process. A single batch for vXEN is set at a fixed amount of 5 vXEN, with the value per vXEN token being fixed at $1.00. Similarly, a single batch for vUSDy is set at a fixed amount of 5 vUSDy, with the value per vUSDy token being fixed at $1.00. The amount of XEN token variant needed to acquire a batch of vXEN will be dynamic, adapting to the ever-changing market price of each XEN token variant. However, the amount of YSL.IO token variant needed to acquire a batch of vUSDy will be fixed, varying based on the specific YSL.IO token being burned.

By implementing this calculation, we ensure that users receive discounts in proportion to the volume of a specific token (vXEN or vUSDy) they burn. Furthermore, we are proud to emphasize that 100% of the burn fees collected are directed toward XNF stakers, and the protocol fee will be used to support the ecosystem. This approach not only encourages efficiency but also rewards our valuable contributors, establishing a mutually beneficial ecosystem. Plus, with the maximum discount of 75% for 10,000 batches, the more users burn, the more they save! This exciting prospect not only offers substantial benefits for those who burn but also generates enhanced rewards for XNF stakers.

## ◽️ Time-Weighted Gas Coefficient

To initiate the burn function on Xenify, users must have a sufficient wallet balance of native chain tokens that meets or exceeds the amount required for the Protocol Fee and Burn Fee. The Burn Fee (BF) is calculated by the protocol using the following formula:

<br>

$$
BF = (GC \times VB) \times (1 - (NB \times CS))
$$

<br>

The calculation includes a time-weighted factor called Gas Coefficient (GC), which determines how much gas is needed to execute the burn function based on the value of batches being burned. As illustrated in the table below, the Gas Coefficient starts at 50% when a cycle begins and increases by approximately 2.174% every hour until it reaches 100% in the final hour of the daily cycle. This means that users will need to contribute more to execute the burn function as the day goes on. However, it also provides an opportunity for users who burn earlier in the cycle to get a discount of up to 75% during the first hour of each cycle. 

| Hour | Gas Coefficient (GC) |
|------|----------------------|
| 1    | 50.00%               |
| 2    | 52.17%               |
| 3    | 54.35%               |
| 4    | 56.52%               |
| 5    | 58.70%               |
| 6    | 60.87%               |
| 7    | 63.04%               |
| 8    | 65.22%               |
| 9    | 67.39%               |
| 10   | 69.57%               |
| 11   | 71.74%               |
| 12   | 73.91%               |
| 13   | 76.09%               |
| 14   | 78.26%               |
| 15   | 80.43%               |
| 16   | 82.61%               |
| 17   | 84.78%               |
| 18   | 86.96%               |

![Grey V4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60996729/235287926-6b18081e-ca41-48c7-8dfc-29cc32c598f1.png)

## ◽️ Time-Weighted Burn Fee Discount

Xenify's time-weighted burn fee discount, is designed to promote fairness and curb unfair practices such as reward sniping and front-running. The burn fee formula helps the protocol determine the fee required to execute the burn function, and it's calculated using the following formula:

<br>

$$
BF = (GC \times VB) \times (1 - (NB \times CS))
$$

<br>

In this formula, BF represents the Burn Fee, which is the fee you will need to pay in the native tokens when using the burn function. The burn fee discount you receive is represented by the term (1 - (NB x CS)). The discount you obtain will be influenced by the Number of Batches (NB) you burn and the applicable Discount Coefficient (CS).

The Discount Coefficient (CS) is a time-weighted factor that varies depending on when a user decides to burn during a cycle. The table below illustrates how the value of the coefficient changes during a 24-hour cycle. It starts at 0.00005 when the cycle begins and decreases by 0.0000025 every hour until it reaches zero after 20 hours. As a result, users will not benefit from the burn fee discount during the last four hours of the cycle.

<br>

| Hour | Discount Coefficient (CS) |
|------|----------------|
| 1    | 0.00005        |
| 2    | 0.0000475      |
| 3    | 0.000045       |
| 4    | 0.0000425      |
| 5    | 0.00004        |
| 6    | 0.0000375      |
| 7    | 0.000035       |
| 8    | 0.0000325      |
| 9    | 0.00003        |
| 10   | 0.0000275      |
| 11   | 0.000025       |
| 12   | 0.0000225      |
| 13   | 0.00002        |
| 14   | 0.0000175      |
| 15   | 0.000015       |
| 16   | 0.0000125      |
| 17   | 0.00001        |
| 18   | 0.0000075      |
| 19   | 0.000005       |
| 20   | 0.0000025      |
| 21   | 0              |
| 22   | 0              |
| 23   | 0              |
| 24   | 0              |              

<br>

Let's take a closer look at how the Discount Coefficient (CS) operates in different scenarios:

![Grey V4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60996729/235287926-6b18081e-ca41-48c7-8dfc-29cc32c598f1.png)

## ♦️ Scenario 1: User burns during Hour-1 of a cycle

  - Let’s say you decide to burn 10,000 batches valued at $5,000 during the first hour of the daily cycle. Taking into account that the Discount Coefficient (CS) during the first hour of a cycle is 0.00005 and the Gas Coefficient (GC) during the first hour is 50%, the protocol will determine your Burn Fee (BF) as $1,250.

<br>

$$
BF = (0.5 \times 5,000) \times (1 - (10,000 \times 0.00005)) = $1,250
$$

<br>

![Grey V4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60996729/235287926-6b18081e-ca41-48c7-8dfc-29cc32c598f1.png)

## ♦️ Scenario 2: User burns during Hour-24 of a cycle

  - Now, let’s say you decide to burn 10,000 batches during the last hour of the daily cycle. Taking into account that the Discount Coefficient (CS) during the last hour of a cycle is 0 and the Gas Coefficient (GC) during the last hour is 100%, the protocol will determine your Burn Fee (BF) as $5,000.

<br>

$$
BF = (1 \times 5,000) \times (1 - (10,000 \times 0)) = $5,000
$$

<br>

Comparing these scenarios highlights the benefits of burning batches in the first hour versus the final hour. The maximum savings of 75% are only possible if you burn 10,000 batches during the first hour of the daily cycle. This time-weighted mechanism mitigates unfair practices and enhances fairness, rewarding users who execute burns earlier in the cycle with the greatest discounts.

![Grey V4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60996729/235287926-6b18081e-ca41-48c7-8dfc-29cc32c598f1.png)

## ◽️ XNF Cycle Distribution

Xenify adopts a balanced approach to reward distribution, focusing on essential components of the protocol: burn fees, swap fees, and contributions from the YSL.IO protocol. Each element is granted an allocation of the daily reward cycle distribution, with 50% reserved for token burns, and the remaining 50% apportioned between swap fee contributions and contributions from YSL.IO vaults. For instance, if the daily XNF cycle distribution is 20,000 XNF tokens, Xenify will divide the rewards, allocating 10,000 XNF for burn fee contributions and 10,000 XNF between swap fee contributions and YSL.IO vault contributions.

To ascertain each user's allocation of the daily distribution of XNF tokens, the protocol will perform a series of calculations. These calculations will be based on the swap and burn contributions made during the cycle. The protocol will consolidate these contributions to accurately compute the total XNF distribution for each user. This methodical approach ensures an equitable distribution, crediting both the user's active engagement in token burns and their contribution in terms of swap fees.

The protocol calculates the burn contribution (BC) of a specific user in a cycle, based on the total XNF tokens distributed (TCD), the total number of batches burned by all users (TBB), and the number of batches burned by the specific user (UBB). Here's the formula explained in detail:

<br>

$$
BC = (TCD \div 2) \times (UBB \div TBB)
$$

<br>

**Where:**

- *BC* - represents the burn contribution of the user.
- *TCD* - is the total amount of XNF tokens distributed in a cycle.
- *UBB* - is the number of batches a specific user has burned in a cycle.
- *TBB* - is the total number of batches burned in a cycle by all users.

<br>

Here’s how it works: The protocol calculates the burn contribution by first dividing the total tokens distributed during a cycle (TCD) by 2, as half of the XNF daily reward cycle is allocated to participants that burn vXEN or vUSDy. It then calculates the proportion of batches burned by the specific user (UBB) to the total batches burned by all users (TBB). This results in a value per batch burned. Finally, the protocol multiplies these two values to determine the user's individual burn contribution within that cycle (BC).

The calculation of the swap contribution follows a similar logic, whereby the protocol calculates the swap contribution (SC) of a specific user in a cycle, based on the total XNF tokens distributed (TCD), the total swap fees paid by all users (TSF), and the swap fees paid by the specific user (USF). Here's the formula explained in detail:

<br>

$$
SC = (TCD \div 2) \times (USF \div TSF)
$$

<br>

**Where:**

- *SC* - represents the swap contribution of the user.
- *TCD* - is the total amount of XNF tokens distributed in a cycle.
- *USF* - is the swap fees paid by a specific user in a cycle.
- *TSF* - is the total swap fees paid in a cycle by all users.

<br>

Here’s how it works: The protocol calculates the user's swap contribution (SC) by first dividing the total XNF tokens distributed (TCD) by 2, as half of the XNF daily reward cycle is allocated to participants that perform swaps on supported chains. It then multiplies the result by the ratio of the user's swap fees (USF) to the total swap fees (TSF) paid by all users. This generates a specific value for each unit of swap fee paid and helps in determining the proportion of XNF tokens a user receives based on their individual contribution to the swap fees in a given cycle.

## ◽️ Automatic Staking of XNF Tokens

Unclaimed and staked XNF tokens both contribute to a user's accumulation of native chain rewards, with each user's share determined by their stake in the total reward pool. The Xenify protocol has been designed with users in mind, incorporating an automatic staking system to ensure their allocation of XNF tokens is seamlessly staked on their behalf upon distribution.

This means that token holders can enjoy the benefits of earning native chain rewards the moment they receive their XNF tokens, eliminating the hassle of collecting and staking XNF tokens during each cycle. For users who prefer a more hands-on approach, manual staking of tokens is also available. With this auto-staking mechanism, users can compound their XNF stake and increase their share of the rewards.

When the Xenify protocol automatically stakes XNF tokens, it adheres to the one-cycle unstaking rule. This means that staked XNF tokens are held for one full daily cycle, even during any 'gap cycles'. Once the required staking cycle is complete, users can choose to unstake their XNF tokens and regain full ownership.

![Grey V4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60996729/235287926-6b18081e-ca41-48c7-8dfc-29cc32c598f1.png)

## ◽️ Unstaking XNF Tokens

To guarantee a secure and effective ecosystem, staked XNF tokens are held for one complete daily cycle, even during any 'gap cycles'. Staked tokens begin to accumulate native chain rewards within the same cycle they are staked. These native chain rewards are collected into a reward pool during each cycle, and subsequently distributed by the protocol among XNF stakers at the end of the daily cycle.

Once the compulsory staking cycle has concluded, users can opt to unstake their XNF tokens and regain full ownership. At this stage, all earned native chain rewards are instantly sent to the user, ensuring a seamless and rewarding experience.

![Grey V4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60996729/235287926-6b18081e-ca41-48c7-8dfc-29cc32c598f1.png)

## ◽️ Collecting XNF Token

Collecting XNF is not necessary, as all XNF tokens are automatically staked for the user by the protocol with each daily distribution. This auto-staking mechanism enables users to enjoy an allocation of the native chain rewards accumulated during that cycle. Alternatively, users can choose to collect or unstake their XNF for trading purposes once the mandatory staking cycle for the tokens has ended. Regardless of the preference, Xenify provides flexibility and control for every user.

![Grey V4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60996729/235287926-6b18081e-ca41-48c7-8dfc-29cc32c598f1.png)

## ◽️ Claiming Native Chain Rewards

Xenify empowers users to effortlessly claim and withdraw their accumulated native chain rewards at their convenience. However, be aware that a 25% Claim Fee will be applied when claiming your native chain rewards. To sidestep the 25% Claim Fee, simply click the "Recycle" button. This enables you to use your accumulated native chain tokens to acquire XNF by participating in the daily burn of vUSDy, avoiding the Claim Fee entirely. Throughout each cycle, the native tokens collected from this fee are stored in a temporary pool. 

At the end of the cycle, these tokens are exclusively distributed among XNF stakers who have employed the Recycle function during the cycle. This unique distribution occurs during the protocol's daily distribution of native chain rewards, with each eligible participant receiving a share based on their position. For instance, if a user recycles their rewards during a cycle, they will be included in the distribution of proceeds generated from the Claim Fee at the end of that cycle.

![Grey V4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60996729/235287926-6b18081e-ca41-48c7-8dfc-29cc32c598f1.png)

## ◽️ Recycling Native Chain Rewards

Opting to recycle your native chain rewards is a smart move, as it not only helps you avoid the 25% claim fee but also enables you to grow your XNF position, with 100% of your accumulated rewards used to join the daily vXEN burn. 

What's even better is that the protocol mints vXEN equal to 100% of your rewards' value and takes the burn fee from your reward balance. This means you're effectively burning vXEN without adding an extra burn fee to your contribution!

Moreover, by utilising the recycle function, you'll be part of the exclusive distribution of native tokens generated from the 25% claim fee during a cycle. To benefit from this recycling feature, you’ll need to have a sufficient balance of native chain rewards to acquire at least one batch of vXEN for the burn process. If your reward balance lacks the necessary amount of native chain tokens, the recycle option will be unavailable to you.

![Grey V4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60996729/235287926-6b18081e-ca41-48c7-8dfc-29cc32c598f1.png)

## ♦️ Recycle Process Overview

  - You decide to recycle your native chain rewards.
  - When this happens, the protocol will use Chainlink's price oracle to determine the dollar value of the native chain token balance.
  - Next, the protocol mints an appropriate number of vXEN batches based on the dollar value of your contribution. This depends on the current value of your native chain rewards, with the protocol rounding down to the nearest batch count.
  - For example, If the protocol determines your native chain rewards to be worth $101.00 in BNB, the protocol will mint 100 vXEN, equal to 20 batches of vXEN. As one batch equals 5 vXEN, 20 batches is the optimal batch amount for your native chain reward balance, rounding down from 20.2 ($101.00/5) to an optimal batch amount of 20.
  - All of the minted vXEN will be burned to obtain XNF (distributed at the end of the burn cycle), with the protocol collecting a burn fee from your native chain rewards balance. The burn fee collected will depend on four variables: the value of the batches (VB) being burned, the number of batches (NB) being burned, the time-weighted gas coefficient (GC) and time-weighted discount (CS).
  - After the burn process, the remaining native chain rewards are sent to the Recycling Contract. For example, if $20.00 BNB from your $101.00 BNB recycling contribution was used for the burn fee for 100 vXEN, the remaining $81.00 BNB will go to the Recycling Contract.
  - The Recycling Contract splits the native tokens three ways: 50% for creating XNF liquidity, 25% for creating XEN liquidity, and 25% allocated to the team as USDC to support Xenify's ongoing development, marketing, and outreach initiatives.
  - The XNF LP tokens and XEN LP tokens acquired from the recycling process are burned.
  - At the end of the daily burn cycle, you'll receive XNF tokens based on the vXEN burned from your recycled contribution. The protocol automatically stakes these XNF tokens on your behalf.
  - Finally, you'll receive your share of daily native chain rewards based on your staked XNF balance, as well as your share of the native chain tokens (e.g., BNB) collected from the claim fee during the cycle.

![Grey V4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60996729/235287926-6b18081e-ca41-48c7-8dfc-29cc32c598f1.png)

## ◽️ Native Token Reward Distribution

During each cycle, the accumulation of native tokens unfolds, wherein the protocol's reward pool gradually accumulates tokens generated from burn fees and swap fees. The balance of this reward pool will continue to grow with every transaction during the cycle, be it a swap or a burn. 

As the cycle concludes, the yield generated from the rehypothecation of YSL.IO AlphaVault and MetaVault assets is added to the reward pool. Subsequently, the total sum of the reward pool is carefully distributed among XNF stakers based on the total number of XNF tokens an individual has staked within the protocol.

This will encompass both uncollected and staked tokens, ensuring fairness and inclusivity. With this unique reward structure, Xenify is able to strengthen the demand and value for XNF and provide a compelling incentive for holders to actively participate in the protocol. This in turn, encourages long-term engagement while cultivating a growing user base and fortifying the protocol's growth.

# ◽️ Genesis Airdrop
![Line Divider - Filled](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60996729/233879462-b465c484-4c2f-4cd2-a126-19529e333d64.png)

<br>

To kickstart liquidity creation on the genesis chain and encourage user participation, we're conducting an exclusive Genesis Airdrop event, featuring 500,000 XNF tokens on the BNB Chain where the XNF contract will be first deployed! 

This one-of-a-kind airdrop is exclusively available to those who recycle their native chain rewards before the first XNF halving event, which occurs 3 months after the XNF deployment on the BNB Chain.

With 75% of the recycled rewards used for liquidity creation, our Proof of Participation approach not only encourages positive user engagement through the recycle function but also helps Xenify build a robust liquidity pool on its Genesis chain.

Eligible XNF stakers who recycle native chain rewards before the first halving event will receive their share of the airdrop proportional to their individual recycle contributions – whether through manual recycling on Xenify or automatic recycling via the XNF AceVault. Your allocation will be based on the total value you've recycled. Simply put, the more native chain rewards you recycle, the larger your share of the Genesis Xenify Airdrop!

The 500,000 XNF tokens will be distributed as locked tokens after the first XNF halving event, gradually unlocking with each new block over a period of 730 days. Keep in mind that locked XNF tokens are not eligible for staking. For example, if you receive 100 locked XNF tokens from the airdrop, you can expect approximately 0.13699 XNF tokens to be unlocked in your wallet each day (100 XNF tokens / 730 days = 0.13699 XNF tokens per day).

# ◽️ Future Xenify Airdrops
![Line Divider - Filled](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60996729/233879462-b465c484-4c2f-4cd2-a126-19529e333d64.png)

Just like the Genesis Xenify Airdrop, we'll be distributing 500,000 XNF tokens as an airdrop for each chain that Xenify deploys. This exclusive airdrop is reserved for eligible XNF stakers who have recycled their native chain rewards, as a token of appreciation for their active engagement with the protocol. The portion of the airdrop an XNF staker receives will depend on the total value they have recycled. In short, the more native chain rewards you recycle, the larger your share of future XNF airdrops.

When Xenify launches on a second chain (following its Genesis launch on BNB Chain), the 500,000 XNF tokens will be distributed among eligible XNF stakers who have recycled on BNB Chain.

From that point on, the 500,000 XNF tokens will be equally divided among each active chain where Xenify has been deployed. For example, let's say Xenify is currently operating on two chains, BNB Chain and Polygon. In this scenario, the next 500,000 XNF airdrop will be evenly distributed between the two active chains, with 50% going to eligible XNF stakers who have recycled on BNB Chain and 50% to eligible XNF stakers who have recycled on Polygon.

Introducing [Phoenix Apes](https://docs.ysl.io/protocol-features/Phoenix-NFT), the exclusive NFT collectible that unites the Xenify and YSL.IO communities. By owning one of these extraordinary NFTs, users of Xenify will unlock a daily amplified burn effect, exponentially boosting their batch count by up to 100 when burning vXEN or vUSDy. Moreover, owning or renting a minimum of 4 of these highly coveted NFTs will grant you an even greater amplification, with your wallet receiving a daily bonus of up to 1,000 batches.

Furthermore, holders of the Phoenix NFT will enjoy a range of extra perks. This includes the opportunity to earn USDC rewards every 8 hours and bypass the Sigma Exit Rate on the YSL.IO protocol. These additional benefits enhance user engagement while making significant contributions to the growth of both the Xenify and YSL.IO ecosystems.

Every wallet that holds a Phoenix Ape NFT is subject to a Weekly Outbound Quota (WOQ) that permits a single outbound transaction involving a Phoenix Ape NFT every 7 days. Outbound transactions include transferring a Phoenix Ape NFT to another wallet or selling the NFT. Please note that while the WOQ restriction is in effect, wallet holders are still permitted to bridge the utility of their Phoenix Ape NFT(s) to another chain. In short, bridging the utility of an NFT to a different chain neither triggers the WOQ nor impacts the user's ability to bridge their Phoenix Ape NFT(s) utility.

And here's the best part: Your daily batch bonus, whether you possess one NFT or four NFTs, can seamlessly be bridged to any chain that Xenify launches. With your burn bonus resetting each day, you'll have the opportunity to reap the benefits of this amplified burn effect across all chains Xenify launches on a daily basis!

## ◽️ Daily Amplified Burn Effect

Phoenix Ape NFT holders unlock an exclusive amplified burn effect when they choose to burn vXEN or vUSDy on Xenify. This unique advantage empowers NFT holders to secure a larger share of the daily distribution of XNF, while also benefiting from significant discounts on their burn fees. By bridging both communities, this exceptional benefit fosters unity and fuels growth for both protocols.

Here's how it works: When Phoenix Ape NFT holders decide to burn vXEN or vUSDy on Xenify, they unlock a daily burn bonus that doubles their batch count (NB). The bonus is capped at 100 daily batches per NFT ID. Once a user uses up all 100 daily bonus batches allocated to their Phoenix Ape NFT, that specific NFT will no longer offer an amplified burn for that day.

Looking for extra firepower? We've got fantastic news! By owning or renting at least 4 of these highly sought-after NFTs, you'll benefit from even greater amplification, with your wallet receiving a daily bonus of 1,000 batches. This effectively replaces the default 100 daily bonus batches reserved for each of your four NFT IDs. In short, if you hold 4 NFTs, your total daily bonus will be capped at 1,000 batches, not 1,400 batches.

Remember, the more batches you burn, the more you save on burn fees. By holding 4 NFTs, you can achieve maximum savings of 75% off your burn fees by burning just 9,000 batches during the first hour of a cycle instead of the usual 10,000. Plus, with Phoenix Ape NFTs having a limited supply of 520, there can only be a maximum of 130 wallet addresses that can seize this extra firepower.

And here's the best part: Your daily batch bonus, whether you have one NFT or four NFTs, can be seamlessly bridged to any chain that Xenify launches. Let's say Xenify expands to Polygon and you hold 4 Phoenix Ape NFTs. Once you've exhausted your daily 1,000 batch bonus on the BNB Chain, you can easily bridge the utility of your NFTs to Polygon and enjoy 1,000 bonus batches there. With your multiplier resetting every day, you'll have the opportunity to reap the benefits of this amplified burn effect across all chains Xenify launches on a daily basis!

In summary, holders of Phoenix Ape NFTs not only enjoy an increased share of the daily XNF distribution but also unlock greater discounts on the burn fee by burning a larger amount of batches. The maximum amount of batches per transaction is capped at 10,000 batches, and the burn fee discount is represented by the term (1 - (NB x CS)) in the protocols burn fee formula:

<br>

$$
BF = (GC \times VB) \times (1 - (NB \times CS))
$$

**Where:**

- $BF$ (Burn Fee) - The fee charged for the burn function, paid in the native token of the blockchain.
- $GC$ (Gas Coefficient) - A time-weighted coefficient used to determine the value of gas required for the burn function to execute the transaction.
- $VB$ (Value of Batches) - The dollar value of batches being burned by the user.
- $CS$ (Discount Coefficient) - A time-weighted coefficient used to factor in the discount on the burn fee.
- $NB$ (Number of Batches) - The number of batches the user burns, influencing the discount in burn fees as the number of batches increases. This will be capped at 10,000 batches.

## ◽️ Example: Amplified Burn Effect

Let's take a closer look at how the amplified burn works in different scenarios:

![Grey V4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60996729/235287926-6b18081e-ca41-48c7-8dfc-29cc32c598f1.png)

## ♦️ Scenario 1: If you hold between 1 and 3 Phoenix Ape NFTs

  - Each Phoenix Ape NFT is equipped with a daily bonus multiplier limited to 100 batches. When burning a specific number of batches, the protocol first verifies if any of your NFTs possess a bonus balance. If so, the protocol uses your bonus balance to increase your batch count. 

  - For instance, imagine you have a daily bonus of 100 batches on your NFT and opt to burn 10 batches. The protocol will effectively double your batch count to 20 batches, by utilising 10 of your daily bonus batches. Consequently, 10 batches from your NFT ID's daily bonus will be deducted, leaving 90 bonus batches for that NFT on that day.

  - However, if you decide to burn an amount exceeding your bonus balance, the protocol will consume the entire balance of your NFT. For example, if your current daily bonus balance is 90 batches and you choose to burn 5,000 batches, the burn process will count it as 5,090 batches, using up the entire 90 batches from your NFT's bonus balance. As a result, 90 bonus batches allocated to the NFT ID will be removed, leaving zero bonus batches for that NFT on that day. Fear not, your bonus batch count will reset to 100 the following day.

  - Additionally, you have the option to bridge your NFT's utility to another chain where Xenify has launched. By doing so, you can access an extra 100 daily bonus batches on that day, effectively granting you 200 daily bonus batches for your NFT. For example, if you've exhausted your daily bonus on the BNB Chain, simply bridge your NFT's utility to Polygon and receive 1,000 daily bonus batches on Polygon. This process can be repeated for each chain where Xenify has been deployed.

![Grey V4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60996729/235287926-6b18081e-ca41-48c7-8dfc-29cc32c598f1.png)

## ♦️ Scenario 2: If you hold 4 or more Phoenix Ape NFTs

  - If you own or rent 4 Phoenix Ape NFTs, burning batches becomes even more rewarding. Your wallet will receive a daily bonus of 1,000 batches. This effectively replaces the default 100 daily bonus batches reserved for each of your NFT IDs. In short, if you hold 4 or more NFTs in your wallet, your total daily bonus will be capped at 1,000 batches for that wallet. When you choose to burn a batch amount that is less than your current daily bonus, the protocol will double your batch count by using an equivalent amount. 

  - For instance, if you have 4 NFTs and a daily bonus of 1,000 batches, burning 1 batch will be counted as 2 batches during the burn process. This means that 1 batch will be deducted from your daily NFTs bonus, leaving you with 999 bonus batches for the day on that chain.

  - On the other hand, if you decide to burn a batch amount greater than your current daily bonus, the protocol will utilise your entire bonus balance. Let's say you have 4 NFTs and a daily bonus of 1,000 batches. If you choose to burn the equivalent of 6,000 batches, it will be counted as 7,000 batches during the burn process. The protocol will use your entire daily batch bonus of 1,000 for this. As a result, you won't have any bonus batches remaining to use for that particular day on that chain. But don't worry, once the next day begins, your bonus batch count will reset back to 1,000.

  - Additionally, you can choose to bridge the utility of your 4 NFTs to another chain that Xenify has launched. By doing this, you can use an additional 1,000 daily bonus batches on that day, effectively giving you 2,000 daily bonus batches. For example, if you've used up your daily bonus on the BNB Chain, you can simply bridge your NFTs' utility to Polygon and receive 1,000 daily bonus batches on Polygon. You can repeat this process for each chain where Xenify has been deployed.

## ◽️ Claimable USDC Rewards

The Phoenix NFT has been designed to be a game-changer in the world of NFTs. With its innovative rental mechanism, this unique NFT actively supports the YSL.IO ecosystem and allows users to generate rental income, whilst renters enjoy the advantage of bypassing the protocol’s Sigma Exit Rate. When a Phoenix Ape NFT is rented through the YSL.IO marketplace, a portion of the user's rental income is collected as tax. Combined with a share of royalty taxes from OpenSea, these earnings are then distributed among all Phoenix Ape NFT holders as USDC rewards on the BNB Chain.

These USDC rewards will be available for holders to claim at the end of each 8-hour epoch. And here's the cherry on top: even if a user decides to bridge their Phoenix NFT from the BNB chain to amplify burns with Xenify on another chain, they'll still be eligible for the USDC distribution. In simpler terms, the claimable USDC rewards on the BNB Chain will be reserved for all addresses that hold the Phoenix Ape NFT, regardless of whether they bridge utility to another chain.

![Grey V4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60996729/235287926-6b18081e-ca41-48c7-8dfc-29cc32c598f1.png)

## ◽️ Bypassing the Sigma Exit Rate
    
The YSL.IO protocol has been purpose-built to provide stability and resilience for all participants. The protocol showcases an innovative Price Stability Model (PSM) that not only aims to stabilise the price of native tokens (YSL, xYSL, bYSL, and USDy), but also guarantees users experience high exit liquidity and preserves the long-term growth of treasury-owned liquidity.

A crucial component of the PSM is the Sigma Exit Rate, which restricts token sales from a wallet by considering the user's acquisition or last sale of the token. However, privileged Phoenix Ape NFT holders can enjoy the freedom to sell up to 100% of their xYSL, bYSL, or USDy tokens without being subjected to the Sigma Exit Rate. This exclusive feature grants users ultimate flexibility and control over their YSL.IO native token holdings.

We understand that you may have questions about Xenify, its features, and its potential. To help you navigate our platform, we've compiled a list of frequently asked questions that provide clarity and insights into Xenify and its ecosystem.

<br>

## ◽️ Does XNF have an initial supply?
- No, Xenify does not have an initial supply, and there is no pre-mine of XNF tokens. Instead, the protocol distributes XNF tokens through a daily reward to users that participate in the ecosystem through direct burns of vXEN and vUSDy or swapping of tokens via the Xenify aggregator. This approach ensures a fair distribution model and encourages active user engagement in the protocol.

![Grey V4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60996729/235287926-6b18081e-ca41-48c7-8dfc-29cc32c598f1.png)

## ◽️ What does the recycle button do?
- The recycle button is an intuitive feature designed with user-centricity at its core. By clicking the recycle button, XNF stakers can instantly convert their accumulated native chain rewards into staked XNF with a single click. The protocol will first sell your accrued native chain rewards, such as ETH, BNB, and MATIC, and use the proceeds to purchase XNF. Subsequently, the newly acquired XNF will be staked on your behalf, streamlining the process for your convenience.

![Grey V4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60996729/235287926-6b18081e-ca41-48c7-8dfc-29cc32c598f1.png)

## ◽️ Why will XNF appreciate in value?
  - The value of XNF holds the potential to appreciate significantly due to Xenify’s innovative tokenomics, thriving ecosystem, and the increasing demand for native chain rewards. With Xenify's cutting-edge cross-chain aggregator, users can enjoy seamless token swapping and engage in various rewarding activities, which drives protocol adoption and ultimately the value of XNF.

  - Additionally, the scarcity of XNF tokens, brought about by halving events, is likely to boost the token's value as more users choose Xenify as their preferred platform for swapping tokens. This will lead to more native chain rewards for XNF stakers, resulting in a growing demand for XNF tokens. Consequently, the token value is poised to rise due to demand, cementing Xenify's position as a promising project within the XEN ecosystem.

![Grey V4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60996729/235287926-6b18081e-ca41-48c7-8dfc-29cc32c598f1.png)

## ◽️ If I make a stake now when can I unstake?
  - Staked XNF tokens are held for one full daily cycle, even during any 'gap cycles'. After one complete daily cycle has passed, users have the option to unstake their XNF tokens, regaining full ownership. Upon unstaking, all earned native chain rewards are promptly delivered to the user.

![Grey V4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60996729/235287926-6b18081e-ca41-48c7-8dfc-29cc32c598f1.png)

## ◽️ How do I generate rewards with Xenify?
  - Users can generate rewards with Xenify by staking their XNF tokens. In doing so, they will receive native chain tokens such as ETH, BNB, and MATIC on each daily cycle. Each staker will receive a share of the rewards generated from the burn and swap fees collected through the protocol, as well as a share of the yield contributed from the rehypothecation of assets held within YSL.IO AlphaVaults and MetaVaults. This incentive model encourages engagement and contributes to the protocol's long-term growth and sustainability.

![Grey V4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60996729/235287926-6b18081e-ca41-48c7-8dfc-29cc32c598f1.png)

## ◽️ If I make a stake now when will I receive rewards?
  - When you stake XNF tokens, you will receive rewards at the end of the same cycle in which you make the stake. These rewards comprise native chain tokens generated from both swap fees and burn fees collected during the cycle, as well as the yield generated from the rehypothecation of YSL.IO AlphaVault and MetaVault assets. Throughout the cycle, these rewards accumulate in a reward pool, and the protocol distributes the entire reward pool of native chain tokens among XNF stakers at the end of the cycle, ensuring a fair and transparent allocation.

![Grey V4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60996729/235287926-6b18081e-ca41-48c7-8dfc-29cc32c598f1.png)

## ◽️ Are there different ways to participate with Xenify?
- Yes, there are several ways to participate with Xenify, including:

  - Utilise the Xenify aggregator to perform seamless single-click swaps and earn XNF in the process.
  - Engage in direct burns of vXEN or vUSDy to acquire XNF.
  - Stake XNF tokens to earn native chain tokens such as ETH, BNB and MATIC.
  - Purchase a Phoenix Ape NFT to unlock daily amplified burns and more.
  - Contribute to the protocol's growth through community initiatives.

![Grey V4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60996729/235287926-6b18081e-ca41-48c7-8dfc-29cc32c598f1.png)

## ◽️ What happens if there are no token swaps, burns, or yield contributions from YSL.IO AlphaVault and MetaVault assets during a daily cycle?

- In the unlikely event that no swaps occur on Xenify, no users burn either vXEN or vUSDy, and the protocol does not receive any yields from the rehypothecation of YSL.IO AlphaVault and MetaVault assets, the daily XNF cycle distribution will not be carried out. In this scenario, the XNF tokens scheduled for distribution during that cycle will simply not be minted. As a result, the total supply of XNF will decrease by the amount that was intended to be distributed in that cycle.

- For instance, if the daily allocation for a cycle is set at 20,000 XNF, with half allocated for burning activities and the other half reserved for contributions from YSL.IO AlphaVault and MetaVault assets, as well as those who engage in swaps on Xenify, and if no swaps or burns occur during that cycle, the 20,000 XNF will not be minted or distributed. Instead, the total supply of XNF will be reduced by 20,000 XNF at the conclusion of the cycle.

## ◽️ Direct Burns 

  - When a token is burned it's usually sent to an inactive address and removed from circulation, effectively reducing the total supply by the amount burned. On Xenify, Direct Burns happen when users purposefully burn tokens (vXEN or vUSDy) to promote the growth of the protocol.  As a reward for their commitment to the protocol, users receive XNF tokens in exchange for their burned vXEN or vUSDy tokens.

## ◽️ Proof of Burn

  - Proof of Burn is a commitment mechanism where users burn tokens to show their support for the protocol. In exchange, they receive equity.

## ◽️ Swap Volume 
  
  - Swap volume refers to the total value of token swaps executed on the Xenify platform. It serves as the basis for distributing XNF tokens to users during the daily reward cycle.

## ◽️ First Principles 

  - First principles in crypto are the fundamental concepts that underpin decentralised digital currencies. They focus on permissionless access, transparency, trustlessness, decentralisation, and immutability. These principles guide the growth and innovation of cryptocurrencies, enabling informed decision-making and shaping the future of decentralised finance.

## ◽️ Interoperability

  - Interoperability is the ability of different systems, networks, or platforms to seamlessly work together. It allows for the exchange of data, assets, and information without barriers.

![Grey V4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60996729/235287926-6b18081e-ca41-48c7-8dfc-29cc32c598f1.png)

## ◽️ Smart Contracts 

  - Smart Contracts are digital agreements that automatically execute when specific conditions are met, allowing two or more parties to exchange things like money, property, or shares in a transparent and hassle-free way, without needing a middleman. These contracts are like mini-programs stored on a blockchain, and they run as soon as the agreed-upon terms are fulfilled. By automating the process, everyone involved can be confident in the outcome without delays or interference from intermediaries.

## ◽️ DeFi (Decentralised Finance) 

  - DeFi, short for Decentralised Finance, is a financial system that cuts out the middlemen by using blockchain technology. It blends traditional banking with blockchain, replacing some parts of the usual financial system with smart contracts on a blockchain. DeFi delivers financial services on a blockchain, offering a more open, transparent, and user-friendly alternative to traditional financial services.
