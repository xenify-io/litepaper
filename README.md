## ◽️  Advanced Cross-chain Aggregator Capabilities

With Xenify, swapping between chains has never been more seamless and efficient, breaking down barriers and fostering a more interconnected DeFi ecosystem. A standout feature that sets Xenify apart from the rest is that we're a cross-chain meta aggregator of aggregators. While the term may sound complex, it simply means that we bring together multiple cross-chain aggregators onto a single platform. By leveraging our advanced liquidity aggregation protocol, we are able to transform the way users transition between blockchain networks. Moreover, users have the opportunity to earn native tokens from the respective chains on a daily basis, further enhancing their portfolio. With access to competitive rates and exceptional liquidity from 27 aggregators across 50 chains, our users enjoy unparalleled benefits and enhanced flexibility in managing their assets.  

![Grey V4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60996729/235287926-6b18081e-ca41-48c7-8dfc-29cc32c598f1.png)

## ◽️  Emphasis on Equity and Long-term Investment

Xenify places great emphasis on equity and long-term investments. We believe in empowering our users to reap the rewards of our protocol's growth and token value appreciation. By holding a stake in Xenify, users have the opportunity to become a part of our success and stand to potentially generate passive income through staking XNF. To accomplish this, we've developed a range of robust features designed to maximise your benefits as a Xenify user:

![Grey V4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60996729/235287926-6b18081e-ca41-48c7-8dfc-29cc32c598f1.png)

## ♦️ Staking

- Xenify introduces a dynamic staking rewards system that offers significant advantages to XNF stakers. By staking XNF tokens, users become eligible to receive an impressive 100% of burn fees and swap fees generated on supported chains, every single day.

![Grey V4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60996729/235287926-6b18081e-ca41-48c7-8dfc-29cc32c598f1.png)

## ♦️ Recycling

  - Recycling your native chain rewards offers a wide range of benefits and is a strategic decision to consider. By choosing to recycle your rewards, you can bypass the 25% claim fee and simultaneously boost your XNF holdings as 100% of your rewards contribute to the daily vXEN burn. This streamlined burn process is further optimised by the protocol, which mints vXEN equivalent to your rewards value while deducting the burn fee from your reward balance. This mechanism essentially allows you to participate in the daily burn auction without the need for additional native chain rewards to cover mandatory protocol and burn fees associated with the default burn process. At the end of the cycle, you will receive XNF based on the batches contributed to the burn process from your recycled rewards.

  - Moreover, leveraging the recycle function grants you exclusive access to the daily distribution of native tokens generated from the 25% claim fee. Your share of the native chain tokens is proportional to the rewards you recycle during a cycle. For instance, if $100,000 worth of native chain rewards were claimed during a cycle and you are the sole XNF staker recycling rewards, you would receive the entire $25,000 worth of native chain tokens generated from the claim fee when the cycle concludes.

  - When users recycle rewards, their native tokens are strategically utilised to strengthen the ecosystem. 50% of the tokens are used to generate XNF liquidity, 25% is utilised to create liquidity for the XEN token variant of the chain, and the remaining 25% of native tokens are sent to the team as USDC to cover ongoing operational expenses, including platform development, marketing campaigns, and community engagement activities. This mutually beneficial arrangement rewards recyclers for their dedication and active participation in the growth of Xenify, creating a win-win situation for both the earning potential of recyclers and the advancement of the platform.

![Grey V4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60996729/235287926-6b18081e-ca41-48c7-8dfc-29cc32c598f1.png)

## ♦️ Token Burning

- Xenify empowers users to effortlessly burn their XEN tokens or YSL.IO native tokens directly from their wallets to participate in the daily burn auction. This unique burn mechanism integrates two bespoke tokens known as vXEN and vUSDy, the virtual counterparts of XEN tokens and YSL.IO native tokens, respectively. These tokens have a specific purpose - to facilitate the minting of XNF tokens through the burn process.
  
- Consequently, users can engage in the daily burn auction, regardless of the XEN token variant or YSL.IO native token they hold. This burn mechanism goes beyond simply reducing the circulating supply of XEN tokens and YSL.IO native tokens; it embodies a strategic approach that unites the YSL.IO community and the broader XEN communities across all chains, fostering a shared vision that unifies both ecosystems.

![Grey V4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60996729/235287926-6b18081e-ca41-48c7-8dfc-29cc32c598f1.png)

## ♦️ Cross-Chain Swapping

- Xenify enables users to execute seamless cross-chain swaps, making it easier than ever to exchange tokens across 50 different chains. Our streamlined process offers a new level of simplicity in cross-chain token swaps and provides access to 27 aggregators, guaranteeing the most competitive rates available, while delivering an efficient and rewarding experience like never before. 

- But here’s the best part: One of the unique advantages of using Xenify is that every time users pay the 0.5% swap fee on chains where XNF is deployed, they are rewarded with XNF tokens through a daily swap auction. This means that users can enjoy an effortless swapping experience while also accumulating XNF tokens.

- And the rewards don't stop there, as users can take advantage of the opportunity to earn additional daily rewards such as BNB, ETH, and MATIC by simply staking their XNF tokens. Xenify truly revolutionises the cross-chain swapping process; offering users simplicity, competitive rates, and a rewarding experience.

![Grey V4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60996729/235287926-6b18081e-ca41-48c7-8dfc-29cc32c598f1.png)

## ♦️ Fair Equity Distribution

- Xenify is dedicated to promoting fairness and transparency in the distribution of equity among its users. Our unique tokenomics and staking model are designed to reward active participants and long-term holders, creating a strong incentive for users to contribute to the growth of our ecosystem. As our community continues to grow, the equitable distribution of rewards and XNF tokens ensures that everyone benefits, promoting a vibrant and engaged community.

# ◽️ XEN Overview 
![Line Divider - Filled](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60996729/233879462-b465c484-4c2f-4cd2-a126-19529e333d64.png)

<br>

XEN is a project that was launched on the principles of self-custody, trustless consensus, and decentralisation. It is a joint effort of several blockchain enthusiasts who aim to create a fairer, more transparent mining ecosystem.

One of the main goals of XEN is to democratise mining by providing a decentralised platform that allows anyone to participate in the mining process. This is achieved by utilising a Proof-of-Work (PoW) consensus algorithm that is resistant to ASIC mining, thus ensuring that the network remains accessible to individual miners.

In addition to its mining capabilities, XEN also features a native cryptocurrency, XEN token, which is used to incentivise miners and maintain the security of the network. XEN tokens are also used to pay for transaction fees and other network services.

XEN operates on a Proof of Participation (PoP) system, which allows participants to mint their coins. The XEN smart contract employs a fair distribution system based on reward time locks and the total number of participants. XEN's value is linked to its difficulty to be minted, similar to Bitcoin. As more participants join and mint XEN, the total amount of generated XEN drops, making it more scarce and valuable.

One of the key features of XEN is its simplicity, as it is based on the ERC20 token standard with minimal code, no pre-minting, hidden doors, admin keys, or origin wallets. Furthermore, XEN has a supply of zero and can only be minted by the participating community. This makes it inflationary at the beginning and disinflationary as adoption increases. XEN is immutable and has no backing by investors or intrinsic value.

To mint XEN, participants can connect their Ethereum-compatible wallets to the XEN smart contract and specify the number of days they are willing to wait to receive XEN. The smart contract generates a XEN rank (cRANK) based on how many people interacted with the contract before the participant. Participants can also stake XEN for 1 to 1,000 days, with APY rewards starting at 20% on XEN Genesis and decreasing by 1 percentage point every 90 days until it reaches 2%, where it will remain indefinitely.

Overall, XEN represents an innovative approach to mining that emphasises decentralisation, accessibility, and sustainability. XEN's combination of features, simplicity and fairness make it a unique and promising project in the crypto space.

![Grey V4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60996729/235287926-6b18081e-ca41-48c7-8dfc-29cc32c598f1.png)

## ♦️ Unifying the Chains (vXEN)

Introducing vXEN, a groundbreaking solution created by Xenify to simplify the process of burning XEN tokens across different chains, enabling us to unify XEN communities across chains and support the token's deflationary nature. This innovative approach has been made possible by integrating Axelar and LayerZero, decentralised protocols that break down barriers between cross-chain communication with their comprehensive protocol suites.

Think of vXEN as the virtual counterpart of XEN tokens, specifically designed to streamline the burn process and acquire XNF tokens. Furthermore, vXEN opens up the opportunity for holders to participate in Xenify's burn auction on other chains by effortlessly migrating vXEN tokens. 

To acquire vXEN, you’ll need to have the specific native XEN token variant for the chain, like bXEN on BNB Chain. Once you have vXEN tokens, you can choose to join the daily burn auction on that specific chain or seamlessly migrate them to any chain where XNF has been deployed to take part in Xenify's daily distribution of XNF tokens on those chains. For example, if XNF is deployed on Ethereum following its launch on the BNB Chain, you can migrate the vXEN tokens you acquire from BNB Chain (by burning bXEN) to participate in Xenify’s burn auction on Ethereum.

This forward-thinking approach stems from Xenify's strong commitment to fostering interoperability within the XEN ecosystem and making Xenify accessible to XEN communities across multiple chains. As a result, vXEN empowers you to interact seamlessly with any EVM chain that supports the XEN ecosystem, and positions Xenify as a strategic layer 1 burner of XEN. This ensures that every user who burns any variant of XEN tokens on Xenify will be rightfully included in the burn record for the X1 distribution, which is the native token of the new XEN Layer 1 (X1 Chain).

And here's the best part: Xenify has implemented a fixed rate for vXEN, where one vXEN is equivalent to $1.00, and one batch is equivalent to 5 vXEN. This simplifies the entire burn process and eliminates the need for continual calculations. Moreover, our burn function leverages Chainlink to ensure the conversion rate for all XEN token variants will be based on their current market value, which guarantees you always receive the full value for your native XEN tokens.

# ◽️ USDy Overview 
![Line Divider - Filled](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60996729/233879462-b465c484-4c2f-4cd2-a126-19529e333d64.png)

<br>

USDy is a reward token that incentivises participation in the YSL.IO ecosystem with stability and sustainability at its core. Developed with cutting-edge tokenomics, the YSL.IO protocol boasts a host of innovative features that make USDy a standout reward token in the DeFi landscape.

One of the key highlights of USDy is its Price Stability Model (PSM), which ensures a continuous increase in liquidity, even in the face of sell pressure. The protocol achieves this through a combination of autonomous Treasury-Owned Liquidity creation and an ingenious Buyback and Burn feature (UBB), which actively works to stabilise the price of USDy.

Here's how it works: the UBB is activated every 4-epochs if the USDy pool price falls below $0.95. During this time, a portion of the tax from every trade of YSL, xYSL, bYSL, and USDy will be used to purchase and/or burn USDy. Additionally, 15% of every HydraVault deposit will also be used to purchase and burn USDy.

What's more, the protocol generates Treasury-Owned Liquidity for USDy at every point of user interaction, ensuring that as more users join the YSL.IO ecosystem, USDy's liquidity grows autonomously. And to further reduce the supply of USDy and increase its price, the Incentive Buyback mechanism (UIB) kicks in every time someone purchases the YSL token. This mechanism incorporates a 25% incentive to purchase YSL while actively reducing the supply of USDy.

Here's how it works: all of the USDC sent will be used to purchase and burn USDy equivalent to 175%, and as a bonus, users receive a complimentary 25% USDy for each purchase. The result is a reduction in USDy supply and an increase in its price, benefiting USDy holders.

In conclusion, USDy has been carefully crafted by YSL.IO with a focus on price stability, and liquidity growth. With innovative features like UBB and UIB, USDy liquidity will continue to grow autonomously while its price remains stable, creating a sustainable, less volatile, and more robust ecosystem.

## ♦️ Unifying the YSL.IO Ecosystem (vUSDy)

Introducing vUSDy, another groundbreaking solution by Xenify that enables seamless burning of YSL.IO native tokens, thereby unifying the YSL.IO ecosystem and supporting the protocol's cutting-edge Price Stability Model for its native tokens.

This innovative approach to token burning has been made possible through the integration of both Axelar and LayerZero, decentralised protocols that break down barriers between cross-chain communication with their comprehensive protocol suites.

Similar to vXEN, users are not obligated to possess the native XEN token on the Ethereum network in order to participate in Xenify's burn process and acquire XNF. Instead, Xenify empowers users within the YSL.IO ecosystem to effortlessly burn their YSL.IO native tokens directly from their wallets and acquire XNF.

This solution truly reflects Xenify's dedication to interoperability, by expanding the protocol's scope and unlocking endless possibilities through the strategic unification of the XEN and YSL.IO ecosystems, fostering a shared vision that brings both communities together.

vUSDy can be regarded as the virtual counterpart of YSL.IO's reward token, known as USDy. The sole purpose of vUSDy is to facilitate the conversion of YSL.IO native token variants into XNF tokens. It's important to note that acquiring vUSDy requires USDy tokens or a YSL.IO token variant supported by Xenify, such as bYSL or xYSL.

Once you possess vUSDy, you can burn it to participate in Xenify's daily distribution of XNF tokens. With each YSL.IO token variant having a fixed conversion rate, it eliminates the guesswork from determining how much XEN you're required to burn as a batch. In other words, users can always have confidence in the amount of vUSDy they will obtain when burning their YSL.IO native tokens. Please bear in mind that although the conversion rate for vUSDy remains fixed, it will vary depending on the specific YSL.IO native token you choose to exchange, as outlined in the table below:

<br>

| Native Token        | Conversion Rate      |
|---------------------|----------------------|
| USDy                | 1 USDy = 1 vUSDy     |
| bYSL                | 1 bYSL = 5 vUSDy     |
| xYSL                | 1 xYSL = 120 vUSDy   |

# ◽️ XNF & veXNF Overview

At its core, XNF serves as a reward token that stimulates user engagement within the Xenify Protocol. Its unique tokenomic foundation paves the way for a distinctive method of claim and lock, which enhances user engagement and empowers users to manage their locking strategies. Users have the liberty to claim their XNF and determine the lock period, which can span from a minimum of 2 weeks to a maximum of 4 years, providing a personalized interaction with the protocol.

This is where veXNF steps in. veXNF is an ERC-721 non-fungible token (NFT) that users receive upon locking their XNF. The quantity of veXNF minted is directly proportional to the amount of XNF locked and the chosen lock period. veXNF not only mirrors a user's stake in the protocol but also serves as an indicator of the user's 'earning power', which dictates their share in the native chain reward distribution.

However, this 'earning power' is not fixed. Over the lock period, even if it stretches up to the maximum 4 years, the power of veXNF undergoes a gradual decay. This decay signifies a reduction in potential earnings over time, emphasizing the necessity for users to actively and regularly interact with the protocol. To elevate their veXNF power and sustain their earning capacity, users must frequently claim and recycle their rewards, and to retain this power, they are required to extend their lock duration.

For users who aspire to enhance their earning potential from earlier locks, the protocol presents an opportunity to prolong the lock-in period. This action not only maintains or increases the veXNF quantity but also resets the decay schedule, thereby promoting sustained participation within the protocol.

Introducing Xenify, the ultimate cross-chain aggregator of aggregators! Expertly designed to streamline the swapping process for users traversing multiple chains, Xenify offers unmatched capabilities. Powered by an advanced liquidity aggregation protocol, Xenify connects to 27 different aggregators, delivering exceptional liquidity and unbeatable rates across 50 leading chains. Whether you want to swap tokens between Ethereum, BNB Chain, Polygon, or many others, Xenify makes it effortless and rewarding!

Imagine this scenario: you want to trade Token-A on Ethereum for Token-B on BNB Chain. With Xenify, all it takes is a single click and a single transaction on Ethereum. No more hassle of navigating different chains or searching for the best rates – Xenify takes care of everything, providing you with the most favourable rates available. But there's more to Xenify than just cross-chain swaps; It's a meticulously designed ecosystem with unique tokenomics, incorporating a groundbreaking incentive model that benefits all participants. 

Xenify's built-in swap fee mechanism creates a reciprocal environment that rewards platform users with XNF as part of the daily reward cycle, and XNF stakers with 100% of swap fees generated across supported chains. On chains where XNF has yet to be deployed, the swap fee is utilised by the team to promote and enhance the Xenify platform and its associated tokens, ensuring widespread awareness and adoption.

Here's how it works: When you pay the 0.5% swap fee to execute a swap on supported EVM chains where XNF has been deployed, you not only facilitate your transaction but also secure a position in the daily XNF reward cycle for that chain. At the end of each day, 100% of the swap fee is distributed as native chain rewards to staked XNF holders on that specific chain. This means you not only earn XNF tokens based on your swap fee contribution but also reward XNF stakers with native chain tokens. It's a win-win situation for everyone involved.

What's more, Xenify incorporates an ingenious burn mechanism that enables users to burn XEN and USDy tokens to mint XNF. The XEN burning process acts as a strategic layer 1 burner, and here's the exciting part – 100% of the burn fees go back to XNF stakers. This approach not only encourages long-term user engagement but also enhances rewards for those deeply involved with the protocol.

Xenify's innovative approach to staking and rewards, combined with its unique tokenomics model, creates a thoughtfully designed ecosystem that benefits all participants. Whether you're executing cross-chain token swaps or burning tokens to mint XNF, every action you take on the Xenify platform contributes to a reciprocal environment of rewards and engagement. You not only enjoy unparalleled efficiency when swapping tokens across 50 leading chains but also have the opportunity to earn native chain tokens daily and be part of a thriving community. Xenify truly offers the best of both worlds: effortless cross-chain token swapping and significant earning potential.

Xenifiy is a groundbreaking protocol that champions fairness, sustainability, and user engagement. At the heart of its tokenomics structure lies XNF, the platform's native token. XNF serves as the primary incentive for users, with a limited supply of 22.6 million. By engaging in a multitude of protocol activities such as burning, staking and swapping tokens, users are rewarded, fostering a dynamic ecosystem where benefits accrue based on contributions and involvement. With this thoughtful design, Xenify guarantees a level playing field for all users, creating an environment where everyone can reap the rewards and laying the foundation for an equitable, community-driven platform.

## ◽️ Token Supply

XNF is the lifeblood of the Xenify protocol, and features a limited total supply of 22.6 million tokens. The distribution process for XNF is designed with transparency and equity in mind, ensuring a level playing field for all. With no pre-mines, investor allocations, founder allocations, or team allocations, the Xenify protocol fosters an environment of fairness and inclusivity. Users have the opportunity to earn XNF equity by engaging in various activities, such as burning vXEN or vUSDy tokens and swapping tokens across supported chains. This unique token supply model not only promotes active participation but also cultivates a thriving, community-focused ecosystem that everyone can be a part of.

## ◽️ Supply Distribution

With a total supply capped at 22.6 million XNF tokens, strategically divided into three core segments, Xenify has been purposefully designed to reward active participants while promoting a balanced ecosystem:

- **21,000,000 XNF assigned for the daily auctions:** Users that participate in various activities that bolster the ongoing development of the protocol will have the chance to earn a share of the XNF tokens dedicated to the daily auctions.

  - 10,500,000 XNF (50%) is distributed to burn auction participants. If the burn process has not been initiated during a cycle, the daily XNF allocation for burn auction participants will be distributed among swap participants for that cycle. If no swaps or burns occur during a cycle, the XNF allocation will neither be minted nor distributed. As a result, this scarcity-driven mechanism decreases the total supply of XNF, potentially increasing its value.

  - 10,500,000 XNF (50%) is distributed to users who engage in swaps on supported EVM chains. In the absence of swaps during a cycle, the XNF allocation for swap participants will be distributed to burn auction participants for that cycle. If no swaps or burns occur during a cycle, this XNF allocation will neither be minted nor distributed. This action also contributes to reducing the total XNF supply, thus enhancing its scarcity and potential value.

- **100,000 XNF assigned for XNF liquidity creation:** To facilitate this, we have set aside 100,000 XNF for the protocol’s Mint Fee Manager. Each time a user participates in the daily burn of vXEN or vUSDy they will be contributing to the proliferation of XNF liquidity. This initiative bolsters the overall health of the protocol and fosters a robust liquidity pool for our community.

- **1,500,000 XNF assigned as an exclusive airdrop for swap participants:** To encourage engagement, each chain will have an exclusive airdrop of 1,500,000 XNF for users that perform swaps before the deployment of XNF. The airdrop will take place on the first day of launch, and will be distributed as locked tokens, gradually unlocking over 730 days.

Drawing inspiration from Bitcoin, Xenify's distribution model adopts the halving principle. As illustrated in the accompanying graph below, following the 7th halving, the rate of Xenify's daily mint allocation stabilises, ensuring a consistent output of 156.25 XNF tokens per day until the maximum supply is reached in month 2461. This innovative strategy has been thoughtfully engineered to ensure an equitable supply distribution centred around long-term user participation, highlighting Xenify's unwavering commitment to fostering a balanced ecosystem and an engaged community.

## ◽️ XNF Minting Process and Incentives

  - The XNF minting process within Xenify has been meticulously structured to reward users who actively engage with and contribute to the protocol's growth. This initiative ensures an equitable distribution of XNF tokens and fosters a genuinely decentralised and community-driven protocol.

  - Xenify's incentive model is carefully crafted, offering proportionate rewards to users who intensify their engagement with the platform. Such an approach propels further participation, as users stand to acquire newly minted XNF tokens relative to their platform activity.

  - Distribution of XNF tokens follows one-day cycles, initiating with a reward pool of 20,000 XNF tokens. This daily allocation gets split evenly: 50% is distributed to users who burn vXEN or vUSDy tokens, with the remaining 50% reserved for contributors to the platform's swap fee. This daily allocation will extend across all other future deployment chains as well. Through the implementation of a halving model, the daily minting quantity gradually reduces, culminating in the complete distribution of the total 22.6 million XNF tokens by month 2461.

  - Users are further incentivised through the platform's staking mechanism, which allows them to accumulate rewards in the form of chain-specific native tokens, such as ETH on the Ethereum chain. These rewards are generated from various activities within Xenify, specifically from swap fees and burn fees.

  - The unique three-tiered incentive model prompts users to use Xenify to earn XNF, while also rewarding those who stake and lock their XNF tokens. This operates as a flywheel, propelling Xenify's long-term growth while cultivating a vibrant and sustainable reward system that incentivises an ever-growing user base.

![Grey V4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60996729/235287926-6b18081e-ca41-48c7-8dfc-29cc32c598f1.png)

## ♦️ Burn to earn XNF 

  - Xenify empowers users to effortlessly burn their XEN tokens or YSL.IO native tokens directly from their wallets to participate in the daily burn cycle. This unique burn mechanism integrates two bespoke tokens known as vXEN and vUSDy, the virtual counterparts of XEN tokens and YSL.IO native tokens, respectively. These tokens have a specific purpose - to facilitate the minting of XNF tokens through the burn process. Consequently, users can engage in the daily burn cycle, regardless of the variant of XEN token or YSL.IO variant they possess. This burn mechanism goes beyond simply reducing the circulating supply of XEN tokens and YSL.IO native tokens; it embodies a strategic approach that brings together the YSL.IO community and the broader XEN communities across all chains, fostering a shared vision that unifies both ecosystems.

  - To acquire vXEN, you'll need to burn the XEN token variant that the chain supports, such as bXEN on the BNB Chain. This burn function positions the protocol as a key player in the strategic layer 1 burning of XEN tokens. This means, every time you burn your XEN native token variant, your address will be added to the X1 burn record, and in return, you'll acquire vXEN. Please keep in mind that executing this burn will incur a vXEN Mint Fee. During the burn process, the XEN token variant you provided will be burned (permanently removed from circulation) and the vXEN Mint Fee utilised to by the Mint Fee Manager to create protocol-owned liquidity for XNF and XEN. The amount of vXEN batches obtained from this burn process will vary based on the current market value of the specific XEN token variant you choose to burn.

  - Once you possess vXEN, you can participate in Xenify's daily distribution of XNF tokens on any chain that XNF has been deployed by participating in the specific chains burn auction. Please keep in mind that executing the vXEN burn process you will incur a Burn Fee.  During this process, the vXEN will be permanently removed from circulation, with the fee being set aside as rewards for XNF stakers.

  - Likewise, holders of YSL.IO native tokens (bYSL, xYSL, or USDy) can actively engage in the daily burn auction by acquiring vUSDy. Similar to the XEN burning process, executing the burn of your YSL.IO native tokens will require a vUSDy Mint Fee. During this process, the YSL.IO token variant you provided will be permanently removed from circulation and the vUSDy Mint Fee utilised to by the Mint Fee Manager to create XNF protocol-owned liquidity and USDy treasury-owned liquidity for YSL.IO.

  - Once you have acquired vUSDy, you can participate in Xenify's daily distribution of XNF tokens on any chain that XNF has been deployed by participating in the specific chains burn auction. Similar to the vXEN burn process, executing the vUSDy burn incurs a Burn Fee. This process permanently removes vUSDy tokens from circulation, with the collected fee serving as rewards for XNF stakers. It's important to note that the conversion rate for vUSDy remains fixed, but it depends on the specific YSL.IO native token you choose to exchange.

## ♦️ Swap to earn XNF 

  - Xenify is redefining the game with a groundbreaking platform that enables seamless single-click cross-chain transactions across 50 chains, while providing stakers the exciting opportunity to earn native chain tokens daily.

  - Every time users pay the 0.5% swap fee on chains where XNF has been deployed, they are rewarded with XNF tokens through the daily swap auction. This unique advantage enables users to enjoy an effortless swapping experience while simultaneously accumulating XNF tokens.

  - But, the rewards don't stop there. By staking these XNF tokens, users have the opportunity to rake in native chain tokens like BNB, ETH, and MATIC on a daily basis. These native chain rewards stem from multiple sources, including swap fees and burn fees. As a result, users can not only enjoy the efficiency and competitive rates Xenify offers but also gain access to a dynamic and sustainable reward system that enhances their portfolio.

  - By participating in token swaps with Xenify, users play a pivotal role in driving the platform's growth. The swap fees generated on chains where XNF has been deployed are distributed among the XNF stakers on that specific chain. For chains where XNF is yet to be deployed, the swap fees are utilised by the team to support promotional efforts and advance the development of Xenify and its affiliated tokens. This fosters greater awareness and wider adoption of the platform, benefiting the entire community.

  - Moreover, by engaging in swaps on any of the 50 supported chains, users become eligible for an exclusive airdrop of 1,500,000 XNF. Each airdrop event takes place on a chain where XNF is scheduled to be deployed and lasts for 60 days before the launch. All swaps conducted during this period guarantee users a share of the upcoming XNF airdrop. In other words, even though you don’t benefit from a daily XNF allocation when you execute swaps on chains where XNF hasn’t been deployed, you still have the opportunity to be included in an exclusive XNF airdrop.

![Grey V4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60996729/235287926-6b18081e-ca41-48c7-8dfc-29cc32c598f1.png)

## ♦️ Stake XNF to earn native tokens 

  - Distinguishing itself from generic aggregators, Xenify takes pride in its avant-garde incentive model that empowers platform users to execute seamless swaps and embark on a rewarding journey by earning rewards every cycle based on their staked XNF. These rewards are distributed in the form of native chain tokens—a highly liquid asset—signalling a potentially lucrative return for users who stake XNF.

  - XNF stakers play an essential role in Xenify's long-term growth, and in return reap the benefits. For chains where XNF has been deployed, stakers enjoy native tokens generated from swap fees across all supported EVM chains at the end of each cycle. As Xenify continues to broaden its reach, an increasing amount of swap volume is guaranteed, with users eager to benefit from a seamless swapping experience while earning XNF on every swap they make. Consequently, XNF stakers benefit from increased rewards! This equitable model establishes a positive feedback loop, guaranteeing all participants benefit from the ecosystem’s growth proportional to their engagement.

  - In addition to swap fees, XNF stakers on chains where XNF has been deployed, will also earn native tokens at the end of each cycle generated from the burn fee. With XNF adopting the halving model and 50% of the daily mint reserved for those burning vXEN and vUSDy, participating in the daily burn auction is one of the few means to securing a sizable XNF position. As more users burn vXEN and vUSDy to acquire XNF, not only do XNF stakers profit from increased rewards through the burn fee, but XNF liquidity proliferates via the mint fee. This innovative burn cycle implementation creates another positive feedback loop, ensuring the entire ecosystem benefits from user engagement.

  - Xenify's innovative staking model enables users to stake their XNF tokens for an opportunity to receive a steady stream of exceptional rewards in the form of Native Chain Rewards. This distinctive rewards distribution model not only strengthens demand and value for XNF, but also serves as an added incentive for holders to stake their daily XNF distributions. This strategy has been integrated to encourage long-term engagement with the protocol, while cultivating an ever-expanding user base.

![Grey V4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60996729/235287926-6b18081e-ca41-48c7-8dfc-29cc32c598f1.png)

## ◽️ Costs of Swapping on Xenify

Xenify offers a groundbreaking token swap solution that not only simplifies cross-chain transactions but also rewards its users, all the while nurturing the expansion of its ecosystem. Through a 0.5% fee on every token swap, Xenify is able to achieve three crucial objectives: reward its platform users with XNF tokens, provide native chain rewards to XNF stakers, and ensure the continuous development of the protocol.

Here's how it works: When a user initiates a token swap on Xenify, they pay a 0.5% swap fee. This fee is strategically allocated to encourage future growth and incentivize user engagement. On chains where XNF has been successfully deployed, 100% of the swap fee will be  distributed among XNF stakers as daily rewards in the form of native chain tokens. As for other chains where XNF is yet to be deployed or during airdrop events, the swap fee will be allocated to the team to bolster Xenify's ongoing development, marketing, and outreach efforts.

But here's the exciting part, by paying the nominal 0.5% swap fee on chains where XNF is deployed, you not only expedite your transaction but also secure an allocation of XNF from the protocol's daily mint cycle. These XNF tokens can be staked to unlock even greater gains from the native tokens distributed at the end of each daily cycle. As a result, platform users benefit from Xenify's efficiency and competitive rates, while earning rewards and actively shaping the evolution of Xenify's dynamic ecosystem.

![Grey V4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60996729/235287926-6b18081e-ca41-48c7-8dfc-29cc32c598f1.png)

## ◽️ Costs of Burning on Xenify

The Xenify protocol enables users to burn vXEN or vUSDy tokens to secure XNF from the daily XNF reward cycle. Think of vXEN and vUSDy as virtual counterparts of XEN and USDy, respectively. These tokens have been specifically created for seamless conversion into XNF.

By participating in the burn process to acquire XNF, users will encounter certain costs such as transaction gas fees and the mandatory mint fee and burn fee. However, the mint fee and burn fee calculations have been carefully designed to not only ensure a transparent and consistent method for token burning but also reward users with attractive discounts on their burn fees of up to 75%.

The burn fee calculation is designed to consider various factors, including the timing of the burn during a cycle, the number of batches being burned, and their associated value. The best part? The more batches a user burns, the greater the discount they'll enjoy, with potential savings of up to 75% off for 10,000 batches during the first hour of every cycle. This creates an attractive incentive for users to undertake larger burn operations at earlier points in a cycle. 

By implementing this calculation, we ensure that users receive discounts in proportion to the volume of a specific token (vXEN or vUSDy) they burn. Furthermore, we are proud to emphasise that 100% of the burn fees collected are directed toward XNF stakers, and the mint fee will be redeployed to bolster liquidity. This approach not only encourages efficiency but also rewards our valuable contributors, establishing a mutually beneficial ecosystem. Plus, with the maximum discount of 75% for 10,000 batches, the more users burn, the more they save! This exciting prospect not only offers substantial benefits for those who burn but also generates enhanced rewards for XNF stakers. 

But what exactly is a batch? A batch represents a fixed number of tokens, either vXEN or vUSDy, required to participate in the burn process. A single batch for vXEN is set at a fixed amount of 5 vXEN, with the value per vXEN token being fixed at $1.00. Similarly, a single batch for vUSDy is set at a fixed amount of 5 vUSDy, with the value per vUSDy token being fixed at $1.00. The amount of XEN token variant needed to acquire a batch of vXEN will be dynamic, adapting to the ever-changing market price of each XEN token variant. However, the amount of YSL.IO token variant needed to acquire a batch of vUSDy will be fixed, varying based on the specific YSL.IO token being burned.

To obtain vXEN, you simply need to hold a supported XEN token variant and a sufficient amount of native chain tokens to cover the mandatory vXEN Mint Fee. 100% of the XEN token variant you provide will be burned, ensuring your wallet address is included in the burn record for the distribution of X1 - the native token of the new XEN Layer 1 (X1 Chain). 

Just bear in mind that the value of vXEN is fixed at $1.00, with 1 vXEN equal to $1.00 XEN (and XEN token variant) based on its current market value. This means that the required amount for each burn is tailored to the current market value of the specific XEN token variant you're burning, ensuring a fair exchange for all users. For instance, if the current price of bXEN is $0.01, and you hold 10,000 bXEN, the protocol will determine your 10,000 bXEN as equivalent to $100 vXEN (100 vXEN tokens). 

Similarly, if you want to acquire vUSDy, you'll need to have YSL.IO native tokens such as bYSL, xYSL, or USDy and a sufficient amount of native chain tokens to cover the mandatory vUSDy Mint Fee. Keep in mind that when you burn for vUSDy, the protocol will use predetermined rates to convert bYSL, xYSL, and USDy.

![Grey V4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60996729/235287926-6b18081e-ca41-48c7-8dfc-29cc32c598f1.png)

## ◽️ Time-Weighted Burn Fee Discount

Xenify introduces an innovative approach to burn fee discounts that aims to promote fairness and prevent manipulation. By implementing a carefully designed burn fee calculation, the protocol effectively curbs unfair practices where users strategically time transactions to maximise their rewards or incentives.

The Burn Fee (BF) calculation includes time-weighted factors called Burn Fee Coefficient (FC) and Batch Coefficient (BC), which help determine the fee needed to execute the burn function based on the value of batches being burned. The burn fee discount that you obtain will be dependent on the Burn Fee Coefficient (FC) and the Batch Coefficient (BC) that is applicable at the time of burning. Both coefficients are time-weighted, decreasing throughout the daily cycle. This means the effective discount that you obtain will vary depending on when you decide to burn during a cycle. 

To initiate the burn function on Xenify, users must have a sufficient wallet balance of native chain tokens that meets or exceeds the amount required for the Mint Fee and Burn Fee. The mint fee that a user is required to send will be dependent on the underlying market value of the tokens being burned by the user, and the protocol will calculate the Burn Fee (BF) using the formula below:

<br>

$$
BF = (FC \times VB) \times (1 - (NB \times BC))
$$

**Where:**

- $BF$ (Burn Fee) - The fee charged for the burn function, paid in the native token of the blockchain.
- $FC$ (Burn Fee Coefficient) - A time-weighted coefficient used to factor in a discount on the burn fee.
- $VB$ (Value of Batches) - The dollar value of batches being burned by the user, influencing the burn fee as the value of batches increases.
- $BC$ (Batch Coefficient) - A time-weighted coefficient used to factor in the discount based on the batches being burned.
- $NB$ (Number of Batches) - The number of batches the user burns, influencing the discount in burn fees as the number of batches increases. This will be capped at 10,000 batches.

<br>

It's worth noting that the burn fee discount you receive will depend on the current values of the Burn Fee Coefficient (FC) and the Batch Coefficient (BC) at the time of burning. As these coefficients decrease throughout the daily cycle, the effective discount you obtain will vary depending on when you decide to burn during a cycle. This dynamic approach ensures that users have an opportunity to benefit from different discount levels based on their timing.

Xenify's approach to burn fee discounts not only promotes fairness but also provides users with the potential to optimise their savings. By considering the time-weighted coefficients and strategically choosing when to execute burns, users can maximise their discounts and overall value. This innovative approach brings transparency, fairness, and increased benefits to all participants of the Xenify ecosystem.


![Grey V4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60996729/235287926-6b18081e-ca41-48c7-8dfc-29cc32c598f1.png)

## ◽️ Burn Fee Coefficient (FC)

The Burn Fee (BF) needed to execute the burn function will increase as the total value of batches being burned increases, however by executing burns earlier in the cycle users have the opportunity to benefit from a lower burn fee thanks to the Burn Fee Coefficient (FC). 

As illustrated in the table below, the Burn Fee Coefficient starts at 50% when a cycle begins and increases by approximately 2.174% every hour until it reaches 100% in the final hour of the daily cycle. This means that users will need to contribute more to execute the burn function as the day goes on. However, it also provides an opportunity for users who burn earlier in the cycle to get a discount of up to 75% during the first hour of each cycle. 

<br>

| Hour | Burn Fee Coefficient (FC) |
|------|---------------------------|
| 1    | 50.00%                    |
| 2    | 52.17%                    |
| 3    | 54.35%                    |
| 4    | 56.52%                    |
| 5    | 58.70%                    |
| 6    | 60.87%                    |

| 13   | 76.09%                    |
| 14   | 78.26%                    |
| 15   | 80.43%                    |
| 16   | 82.61%                    |

| 23   | 97.83%                    |
| 24   | 100.00%                   |

![Grey V4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60996729/235287926-6b18081e-ca41-48c7-8dfc-29cc32c598f1.png)

## ◽️ Batch Coefficient (BC)

The Batch Coefficient (BC) factors in a discount on the burn fee based on the number of batches you burn. The more batches you burn, the greater the batch discount, represented by the term (1 - (NB x BC)). The value of the Batch Coefficient (BC) varies depending on when a user decides to burn during a cycle. 

The table below illustrates how the value of the coefficient changes during a 24-hour cycle. The constant starts at 0.00005 when the cycle begins and decreases by 0.0000025 every hour until it reaches zero after 20 hours. As a result, users will not benefit from the batch discount during the last four hours of the cycle.

<br>

| Hour | Batch Coefficient (BC)    |
|------|---------------------------|
| 1    | 0.00005                   |

## ◽️ Different Burn Fee Scenarios

Let's take a closer look at how the Time-Weighted Burn Fee Discount operates in different scenarios:

![Grey V4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60996729/235287926-6b18081e-ca41-48c7-8dfc-29cc32c598f1.png)

## ♦️ Scenario 1: User burns during Hour-1 of a cycle

  - Let’s say you decide to burn 10,000 batches valued at $5,000 during the first hour of the daily cycle. Taking into account that the Batch Coefficient (BC) during the first hour of a cycle is 0.00005 and the Burn Fee Coefficient (FC) during the first hour is 50%, the protocol will determine your Burn Fee (BF) as $1,250.

<br>

$$
BF = (0.5 \times 5,000) \times (1 - (10,000 \times 0.00005)) = $1,250
$$

<br>

## ♦️ Scenario 2: User burns during Hour-24 of a cycle

  - Now, let’s say you decide to burn 10,000 batches during the last hour of the daily cycle. Taking into account that the Batch Coefficient (BC) during the last hour of a cycle is 0 and the Burn Fee Coefficient (FC) during the last hour is 100%, the protocol will determine your Burn Fee (BF) as $5,000.

<br>

$$
BF = (1 \times 5,000) \times (1 - (10,000 \times 0)) = $5,000
$$

<br>

Comparing these scenarios highlights the benefits of burning batches in the first hour versus the final hour. The maximum savings of 75% are only possible if you burn 10,000 batches during the first hour of the daily cycle. This time-weighted burn fee mechanism mitigates unfair practices and enhances fairness, rewarding users who execute larger burns earlier in the cycle with greater discounts.

## ◽️ Mint Fee Manager

Xenify's daily burn auction is the perfect opportunity to get your hands on XNF tokens, and all you need is to have vXEN or vUSDy. The process of acquiring these tokens is straightforward - just burn a XEN token variant or YSL.IO native token, respectively. It's a seamless process that grants users access to the daily burn auction and the opportunity to secure XNF. Keep in mind that during the burning process, there is a mandatory Mint Fee based on the current market value of the tokens being burned. 

By providing the Mint Fee, users contribute to the creation of protocol-owned liquidity. This liquidity also paves the way for the distribution of additional rewards in the form of XNF and native XEN tokens to recyclers at the end of each cycle. Consequently, the Mint Fee Manager not only strengthens protocol-owned liquidity but also indirectly generates more rewards for recyclers. This innovative design ensures the sustainability and long-term growth of the Xenify ecosystem. Furthermore, the absence of admin keys in the contract safeguarding the protocol-owned liquidity eliminates any possibility of manipulation.

To kickstart the generation of this protocol-owned liquidity, the Mint Fee Manager receives an allocation of 100,000 preminted XNF tokens when XNF is deployed. These tokens serve the purpose of creating XNF liquidity through the Mint Fee. The team does not have access to these preminted tokens, and can only execute the burning of these tokens if necessary.

Here’s how it works: When a user sends the Mint Fee, the Mint Fee Manager will pair 50% of the native chain tokens with the preminted XNF tokens, to add as XNF liquidity at full range, with all LP tokens being held by the protocol. This process will continue until the preminted XNF allocation is depleted. After that, the manager initiates its default process, which involves using 25% of the native tokens to purchase XNF, pair the acquired XNF with 25% of the native tokens, to add as liquidity at full range, with all LP tokens being held by the protocol.

The remaining 50% of the Mint Fee is designated to create either XEN liquidity or USDy liquidity, depending on whether the user sent the Mint Fee to acquire vXEN or vUSDy, respectively. When the protocol creates USDy liquidity through the vUSDy Mint Fee, the USDy LP tokens are sent to the YSL.IO Treasury. On the other hand, when it generates XEN liquidity via the vXEN Mint Fee, the XEN LP tokens are held by the protocol.

At the end of each cycle, the protocol withdraws 1% of the total XNF LP tokens and 1% of the XEN LP tokens held. The native chain tokens acquired from the withdrawn LP tokens are utilised to purchase XNF and XEN, respectively, with the purchased tokens combined with the withdrawn XNF and XEN tokens, respectively. These purchased tokens are combined with the previously withdrawn XNF and XEN tokens and are subsequently distributed among veXNF holders who have participated in recycling rewards during the previous cycle. The XEN tokens purchased during this process represent the native token for the specific chain, such as bXEN on the BNB Chain. Similarly, the purchased XNF tokens represent the native token for the chain, like bXNF on the BNB Chain.

## ◽️ vXEN Mint Fee

The vXEN mint fee is applicable only when you burn a XEN token variant to obtain vXEN. The mint fee is determined by the current market value of the tokens you burn. The native tokens generated from the vXEN mint fee will be allocated as follows:

- **50% will be used to create XNF liquidity:** The protocol uses 50% of the native tokens to create XNF liquidity for the chain. If the 100,000 Preminted XNF is available, the full amount of the native tokens will be paired with preminted XNF for liquidity pairing, with the LP tokens being held by the protocol. However, if the preminted XNF allocation has been depleted, the protocol will use half of the 50% native tokens to purchase XNF tokens and the remaining 25% of the native tokens for liquidity pairing, with the LP tokens being held by the protocol.

- **50% will be used to create XEN token liquidity:** The protocol utilises 50% of the native chain tokens to create liquidity for the native XEN token variant for the most liquid XEN pool on that chain (for example, on the BNB Chain it will create liquidity for bXEN-BNB liquidity), by using 25% of the tokens to purchase the native XEN token (e.g. bXEN) and the remaining 25% of the tokens for the liquidity pairing with the LP tokens being held by the protocol.

- For example, let's say you have 10,000 bXEN and you want to convert it to vXEN. If bXEN is currently valued at $0.01 and you hold 10,000 bXEN, your bXEN is worth $100. Therefore, you would need to provide $100 in BNB for the mint fee. After you initiate the mint process, the protocol will generate vXEN based on the total value of your bXEN and the mint fee. In this example, you'll receive $200 vXEN in return, considering your $100 bXEN and the $100 BNB mint fee. The $100 worth of bXEN you sent during the process will be permanently removed from circulation, and the $100 BNB contribution for the mint fee will go to the vXEN Mint Fee Manager.

## ◽️ vUSDy Mint Fee

The vUSDy mint fee is only applicable when you convert USDy, xYSL, or bYSL to vUSDy through the burn process. The native tokens generated from the vUSDy mint fee will be allocated as follows:

- **50% will be used to create XNF liquidity:** The protocol uses 50% of the native tokens to create XNF liquidity for the chain. If the 100,000 Preminted XNF is available, the full amount of the native tokens will be paired with preminted XNF for liquidity pairing, with the LP tokens being held by the protocol. However, if the preminted XNF allocation has been depleted, the protocol will use half of the 50% native tokens to purchase XNF tokens and the remaining 25% of the native tokens for liquidity pairing, with the LP tokens being held by the protocol.

- **50% will be used to create USDy treasury-owned liquidity:** The protocol utilises 50% of the native tokens to create USDy-USDC treasury-owned liquidity, by minting the USDy side of the liquidity pairing and purchasing USDC with the 50% of the tokens, with the LP tokens being sent to the YSL.IO Treasury.

- For example, let's say you have 100 USDy tokens and you want to convert them into vUSDy. To cover the mint fee, you need to hold native chain tokens. The mint fee will be determined as $100 BNB, based on the fixed conversion rate of $1.00 per USDy. After you initiate the mint process, the protocol will generate vUSDy based on the total value of your USDy and the mint fee. In this example, you'll receive $200 vUSDy in return, considering your 100 USDy and the $100 BNB mint fee. The 100 USDy you sent during the process will be permanently removed from circulation, and the $100 BNB mint fee will be sent to the vUSDy Mint Fee Manager.

![Grey V4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60996729/235287926-6b18081e-ca41-48c7-8dfc-29cc32c598f1.png)

## ◽️ XNF Cycle Distribution

Xenify employs a balanced approach in the daily distribution of XNF tokens, with a focus on two central components across all the chains it's deployed on: burn fees and swap fees. These components receive an equal share of the daily mint, with 50% allocated to users who participate in burning vXEN or vUSDy tokens, and the remaining 50% distributed among those who engage in swaps.

For instance, if the daily minted amount of XNF tokens is 20,000, the distribution is split evenly. Those contributing to burn fees receive 10,000 XNF tokens, and an equivalent amount is given to those contributing to swap fees. This uniform allocation structure extends to all chains where Xenify is present. Thus, irrespective of the chain they're using, participants involved in either burning tokens or executing swaps have the opportunity to earn a portion of the daily minted XNF tokens.

For example, if the daily XNF mint is 20,000 XNF tokens, Xenify will distribute the allocation two ways: 10,000 XNF is given to those contributing to burn fees, and 10,000 XNF to those contributing to swap fees. This same allocation structure is applied across all other chains where Xenify is deployed. Consequently, regardless of the chain, users contributing to the burning of tokens or engaging in swaps will have an opportunity to earn a portion of the newly minted XNF tokens each day.

To ascertain each user's share of the daily mint allocated to burn and swap contributions, the protocol will perform a series of calculations. These calculations will be based on the swap and burn contributions made by a user during the cycle. The protocol will consolidate these contributions to accurately compute the total XNF distribution for each user. This methodical approach ensures an equitable distribution, crediting both the user's active engagement in token burns and their contribution in terms of swap fees.

The protocol calculates the burn contribution (BC) of a specific user in a cycle, based on the total XNF tokens distributed (TCD), the total number of batches burned by all users (TNB), and the number of batches burned by the specific user (UNB). Here's the formula explained in detail:

<br>

$$
BC = (TCD \div 2) \times (UBB \div TBB)
$$

<br>

**Where:**

- *BC* - represents the burn contribution of the user.
- *TCD* - is the total amount of XNF tokens distributed in a cycle.
- *UBB* - is the number of batches a specific user has burned in a cycle.
- *TBB* - is the total number of batches burned in a cycle by all users.

<br>

Here’s how it works: The protocol calculates the burn contribution by first dividing the total tokens distributed during a cycle (TCD) by 2, as 50% of the XNF daily mint is allocated to participants that burn vXEN or vUSDy. It then calculates the proportion of batches burned by the specific user (UNB) to the total batches burned by all users (TNB). This results in a value per batch burned. Finally, the protocol multiplies these two values to determine the user's individual burn contribution within that cycle (BC).

The calculation of the swap contribution follows a similar logic, whereby the protocol calculates the swap contribution (SC) of a specific user in a cycle, based on the total XNF tokens distributed (TCD), the total swap fees paid by all users (TSF), and the swap fees paid by the specific user (USF). Here's the formula explained in detail:

<br>

$$
SC = (TCD \div 2) \times (USF \div TSF)
$$

<br>

**Where:**

- *SC* - represents the swap contribution of the user.
- *TCD* - is the total amount of XNF tokens distributed in a cycle.
- *USF* - is the swap fees paid by a specific user in a cycle.
- *TSF* - is the total swap fees paid in a cycle by all users.

<br>

Here’s how it works: The protocol calculates the user's swap contribution (SC) by first dividing the total XNF tokens distributed (TCD) by 2, as 50% of the XNF daily mint is allocated to participants that perform swaps on supported chains. It then multiplies the result by the ratio of the user's swap fees (USF) to the total swap fees (TSF) paid by all users. This generates a specific value for each unit of swap fee paid and helps in determining the proportion of XNF tokens a user receives based on their individual contribution to the swap fees in a given cycle.

## ◽️ Staking XNF Tokens

Each cycle, Xenify's protocol distributes newly minted XNF tokens to its users. The distribution takes place at the end of each day and adheres to a particular allocation structure. Specifically, 50% of the daily minted XNF is allotted to users who engage in the burning of vXEN and vUSDy tokens, and the remaining 50% is distributed to users who participate in swaps across all supported EVM chains.

Staked XNF tokens play an essential role in the accumulation of native chain rewards for users, with each user's share being determined by their veXNF position and the associated earning power. The staked tokens start to accumulate native chain rewards within the same cycle they are staked. These rewards are gathered into a reward pool during each cycle and then distributed among XNF stakers by the protocol at the end of the daily cycle.

Users aiming to earn a share of native chain rewards on Xenify need to either manually stake their XNF tokens or actively claim their daily XNF allocation. In doing so, they lock their XNF for a chosen staking period, which can be as short as two weeks or as long as four years. Once the desired lock period is set, the user's XNF is staked and locked as per the selected period. Subsequently, the protocol mints veXNF tokens for the user, reflecting the amount of XNF staked and the chosen lock period. Throughout the lock period, users cannot unstake their XNF but continue to accumulate native chain rewards. The distribution of these rewards is determined by the earning power of their veXNF.

![Grey V4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60996729/235287926-6b18081e-ca41-48c7-8dfc-29cc32c598f1.png)

## ◽️ Unstaking XNF Tokens

After completing their chosen staking cycle, users have the option to unstake their XNF tokens. It's important to note that users are unable to unstake their XNF during their specified lock period. However, users will accumulate native chain rewards throughout the lock period. These rewards are directly connected to their veXNF position, with the power of a user's veXNF during the staking cycle determining their share of each reward distribution. 

Once the chosen lock period is over, the earning power of a user's veXNF position will completely decay. This means that they will no longer earn native chain rewards on their position. At this point, users have two choices: they can either extend their stake cycle for a maximum duration of 4 years to preserve the earning power of their veXNF, or they can decide to unstake their XNF tokens and regain full ownership.

The decision of whether to extend the stake cycle or unstake the tokens is entirely up to the user. Xenify provides flexibility for each user to assess their preferences and make an informed decision about the best course of action for their circumstances.

![Grey V4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60996729/235287926-6b18081e-ca41-48c7-8dfc-29cc32c598f1.png)

## ◽️ Claiming Native Chain Rewards

Xenify empowers users to effortlessly claim and withdraw their accumulated native chain rewards at their convenience. However, be aware that a 25% Claim Fee will be applied when claiming your native chain rewards. 

To sidestep the 25% Claim Fee, simply click the "Recycle" button. This enables you to use your accumulated native chain tokens to acquire XNF by participating in the daily burn of vUSDy, avoiding the Claim Fee entirely. Throughout each cycle, the native tokens collected from this fee are stored in a temporary pool. At the end of the cycle, these tokens are exclusively distributed among veXNF holders who have employed the Recycle function during the cycle.

This unique distribution occurs during the protocol's daily distribution of native chain rewards, with each eligible participant receiving a share based on their position. For instance, if a user recycles their rewards during a cycle, they will be included in the distribution of proceeds generated from the Claim Fee at the end of that cycle.

![Grey V4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60996729/235287926-6b18081e-ca41-48c7-8dfc-29cc32c598f1.png)

## ◽️ Recycling Native Chain Rewards

Discover the smart way to maximise your rewards with Xenify's recycling feature! By choosing to recycle your native chain rewards, you'll not only bypass the 25% claim fee but also boost your XNF position, as your entire rewards balance is used to join the daily vXEN burn.

What sets this process apart is the protocol's capability to mint vXEN tokens equivalent to the value of your rewards and directly deduct the burn fee from your reward balance. This means you can burn vXEN without the need for additional native chain rewards to cover the obligatory mint fee or burn fee, which is typically required in the default burn process.

By utilising the recycle function as a veXNF holder, you gain access to an exclusive daily distribution of native tokens generated from the platform's 25% claim fee. This fee is collected whenever a user claims their native chain rewards. At the end of each cycle, the accumulated native tokens are exclusively distributed to veXNF holders who have recycled during the cycle. Your allocation of native chain tokens from the claim fee is based on your veXNF power and the veXNF power of all recyclers combined.

But wait, there's more! As a token of gratitude for their active participation in the protocol, veXNF holders who recycle rewards throughout a cycle also become eligible for an exclusive distribution of XNF and XEN at the end of each cycle. The protocol will acquire XNF and XEN from protocol-owned liquidity, withdrawing 1% of the total XNF LP tokens and 1% of the XEN LP tokens held at the cycle's end. The native chain tokens obtained from the withdrawn LP tokens are then used to purchase XNF and XEN, respectively. These purchased tokens, combined with the withdrawn XNF and XEN tokens, are subsequently distributed among veXNF holders who have participated in recycling rewards during the previous cycle. 

Your share of the withdrawn XEN and XNF depends on the dollar amount of rewards you've recycled, considering the total dollar amount of recycled rewards during the cycle. In essence, by recycling more native chain rewards during a cycle, you can increase your share of the XNF and XEN rewards acquired from the protocol-owned liquidity.

To leverage this recycling feature, ensure that you have a sufficient balance of native chain rewards to acquire at least one batch of vXEN for the burn process. If your reward balance falls short of the required amount of native chain tokens, the recycle option will not be accessible to you. By recycling your native chain rewards, you'll not only strengthen your XNF position but also enjoy a streamlined process that eliminates the usual burn function fees. It's a win-win situation that rewards your active participation and commitment to the growth of Xenify.

![Grey V4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60996729/235287926-6b18081e-ca41-48c7-8dfc-29cc32c598f1.png)

## ♦️ Recycle Process Overview

  - You decide to recycle your native chain rewards.
  - The protocol employs Chainlink's price oracle to ascertain the dollar value of your native chain reward balance.
  - Based on the dollar value of your contribution, the protocol mints an appropriate number of vXEN batches. The number of batches is determined by rounding down to the nearest batch count.
  - All the minted vXEN batches are immediately burned to participate in the daily burn auction, and the protocol collects a burn fee from your recycled native chain rewards.
  - After the burn process, your remaining native chain rewards are sent to the Recycling Contract.
  - The Recycling Contract splits the native tokens three ways: 50% for creating XNF protocol-owned liquidity, 25% for creating XEN protocol-owned liquidity, and 25% allocated to the team as USDC to support Xenify's ongoing development, marketing, and outreach initiatives.
  - The XNF LP tokens and XEN LP tokens acquired from the recycling process are held by the protocol.
  - At the end of the daily burn auction, you receive XNF tokens based on the vXEN batches burned from your recycled contribution.
  - Next, you will receive your share of daily native chain rewards based on your veXNF balance and its associated power.
  - Finally, as a recycler, you will also receive a portion of any native chain tokens collected from the claim fee during the cycle, as well as a share of the XNF and XEN acquired from protocol-owned liquidity.

By recycling your native chain rewards, you'll not only strengthen your XNF position but also enjoy a streamlined process that eliminates the usual fees associated with the daily burn auction. Most importantly, as a dedicated recycler, you will earn native chain tokens generated from the 25% claim fee and qualify for an exclusive distribution of XNF and XEN at the end of each cycle. It's a win-win situation that rewards your active participation and commitment to the growth of Xenify.

![Grey V4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60996729/235287926-6b18081e-ca41-48c7-8dfc-29cc32c598f1.png)

## ◽️ Native Token Reward Distribution

During each cycle, the protocol's reward pool gradually accumulates native tokens generated from burn fees and swap fees. This pool grows with every transaction, whether it's a swap or a burn. The total sum of the reward pool is then distributed among XNF stakers based on their veXNF holdings and associated power.

In addition to the distribution of native tokens from swap fees and burn fees, there are exclusive distributions of native tokens for veXNF holders who have recycled their rewards during the cycle. These additional distributions include native tokens generated from Xenify's 25% claim fee for native chain rewards.

It's important to note that claiming XNF on Xenify doesn't incur a claim fee. However, if veXNF holders choose to claim their native chain rewards, there will be a 25% claim fee. The native chain tokens acquired from this claim fee during a cycle are set aside and distributed among veXNF holders who have recycled in the previous cycle.

With this unique reward structure, Xenify is able to strengthen the demand and value for XNF, while providing a compelling incentive for holders to actively participate in the protocol. This encourages engagement and cultivates a growing user base, helping to fortify the protocol's long-term growth.

# ◽️ XNF Airdrops
![Line Divider - Filled](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60996729/233879462-b465c484-4c2f-4cd2-a126-19529e333d64.png)

<br>

Introducing Xenify's exclusive XNF Airdrop, an initiative aimed at driving user engagement on the platform across multiple EVM chains. To build anticipation for an upcoming launch of XNF on a new chain, a 60-day airdrop event will precede its deployment. As platform users swap tokens, they will be rewarded with a generous allocation of 1,500,000 XNF tokens during this event, providing a fantastic opportunity to benefit from Xenify's growth.

These 1,500,000 XNF tokens will be initially distributed as locked tokens on the launch day, gradually unlocking over a period of 730 days. For instance, if you receive 100 locked XNF tokens from the airdrop, you can expect approximately 0.13699 XNF tokens to be unlocked in your wallet each day. 

Since these tokens will be divided among swap participants based on their daily swap contributions leading up to the launch, the more you swap during the event, the greater your share of the XNF Airdrop will be!

Now, we understand your eagerness to stake those XNF tokens and witness your portfolio flourish. However, there's a small catch – locked XNF tokens cannot be staked. So, if you're aiming to earn a share of the platform's native chain rewards, we highly recommend also taking part in the initial burn auction. It's your ticket to earning a portion of the native chain rewards from the initial distribution!

To ensure fairness and discourage last-minute sniping, a consistent daily allocation of the airdrop will be implemented throughout the event. This guarantees that participants receive a share of the airdrop that reflects their level of engagement. For example, during the 60-day Genesis Airdrop on the BNB Chain, 25,000 XNF tokens will be allocated each day. Your share from the Genesis airdrop will be based on your daily contributions through the swap fee. Imagine being the sole user who swaps on a particular day during the 60-day event – you'll claim an impressive 25,000 XNF from the airdrop!

Furthermore, to maintain engagement, contributions made during an event will not carry over to subsequent airdrops. This policy ensures that users who contribute only once are not consistently included in future airdrops, promoting active participation.

During the pre-deployment phase, while the airdrop event is ongoing, the 0.5% swap fee will not be allocated to veXNF holders. Instead, these fees will be utilised as resources to support the protocol's progression and outreach efforts. However, once XNF has been deployed on a specific chain, 100% of the swap fees generated on that chain will be redirected as daily native chain rewards to veXNF holders (XNF stakers). This creates an attractive incentive for actively participating in the ecosystem's growth and allows users to benefit from Xenify's ongoing swap volume.

# ◽️ Amplify Burns
![Line Divider - Filled](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60996729/233879462-b465c484-4c2f-4cd2-a126-19529e333d64.png)

Introducing Xenify's burn amplification, an opportunity exclusively tailored for Class 1 APEX XENFT (Xunicorn), Class 2 APEX XENFT (Exotic), or [Phoenix Ape NFT](https://docs.ysl.io/protocol-features/Phoenix-NFT) owners. Through ownership of these rare NFTs, you'll unlock a daily amplified burn effect, boosting your batch count by a staggering 100 when burning vXEN or vUSDy. If you own or rent, at least, four of these sought-after NFTs, prepare yourself for an even bigger amplification, as your wallet will receive a generous daily bonus of 1000 batches.

Furthermore, holders of the Phoenix Ape NFT will enjoy a range of extra perks. This includes the opportunity to earn USDC rewards every 8 hours and bypass the Sigma Exit Rate on the YSL.IO protocol. These additional benefits enhance user engagement while making significant contributions to the growth of both the Xenify and YSL.IO ecosystems.

Every wallet that holds a Phoenix Ape NFT is subject to a Weekly Outbound Quota (WOQ) that permits a single outbound transaction involving a Phoenix Ape NFT every 7 days. Outbound transactions include transferring a Phoenix Ape NFT to another wallet or selling the NFT. Please note that while the WOQ restriction is in effect, wallet holders are still permitted to bridge the utility of their Phoenix Ape NFT(s) to another chain. In short, bridging the utility of an NFT to a different chain neither triggers the WOQ nor impacts the user's ability to bridge their Phoenix Ape NFT(s) utility.

And here's the best part: Your daily batch bonus, whether you possess one NFT or four Phoenix Ape NFTs, can seamlessly be bridged to any chain that Xenify launches. With your burn bonus resetting each day, you'll have the opportunity to reap the benefits of this amplified burn effect across all chains Xenify launches on a daily basis!

To make the Phoenix Apes accessible to a wide range of participants, it will be made available exclusively through a weekly auction. This ensures fairness and engagement, giving everyone ample time to secure their prized Phoenix Ape NFT. The auction starts with a minimum starting bid of just 10 bXNF (XNF native to the BNB Chain). This means, if no bids have been placed yet, you can kick off the auction with a minimum bid of 10 bXNF. If there are existing bids, your bid must be either 2 bXNF higher than the current highest bid or 105% of the current highest bid, whichever is greater.

Each weekly auction lasts a minimum of 168 hours and features a time buffer extension of 5 minutes. This means that if a bid is placed within the last 5 minutes of the auction, an additional 5 minutes will be added to the duration, with the auction only ending when no bids are placed within the last 5 minutes of the scheduled end time. This ensures that no auction will start until the current one concludes, giving everyone a fair chance to participate. For instance, let’s say the auction is set to end at 12:00 pm, and a bid is placed at 11:59 am. The end time will be extended to 12:05 pm, and this process continues until there are no bids within the last five minutes, providing every bidder with a fair opportunity.

Furthermore, as soon as a higher bid is placed during the auction, the previous highest bidder receives a full refund of their bXNF. This guarantees fairness throughout the process, as they can use their refunded bXNF to place another bid if they choose to do so. Moreover, 100% of the bXNF acquired from the winning bidder will be burned, further benefiting the Xenify ecosystem.

Once you win the auction, you can claim your Phoenix Ape NFT, which mints your unique NFT. It's important to note that only the wallet address associated with the winning bid can claim the Phoenix Ape NFT, ensuring utmost security for all participants. And here's another important detail: if you're the lucky auction winner, you'll need to claim your Phoenix Ape NFT before participating in subsequent auctions. This mechanism prevents any single participant from accumulating unminted NFTs.

**Let's explore some of the standout features that set Phoenix Ape NFTs apart from conventional NFTs:**

![Grey V4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60996729/235287926-6b18081e-ca41-48c7-8dfc-29cc32c598f1.png)

## ◽️ Limited Collectible

The Phoenix Apes is an NFT collectible that has been designed to unite the Xenify and YSL.IO communities. The exclusive NFT collection developed by YSL.IO, boasts a scarce supply of just 520. These sought-after NFTs have been ingeniously designed with utility at their core. Not only do they possess unique rarities, but they also bestow exceptional benefits upon their holders within the Xenify and YSL.IO ecosystem.

![Grey V4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60996729/235287926-6b18081e-ca41-48c7-8dfc-29cc32c598f1.png)

## ◽️ Daily Amplified Burn Effect

Prepare to unleash the power of your Phoenix Ape NFT, Class 1 APEX XENFT (Xunicorn), or Class 2 APEX XENFT (Exotic) on Xenify! As a proud owner of these remarkable NFTs, you gain access to an exclusive amplified burn effect that takes your burn contribution to new heights. This unique advantage empowers NFT holders to secure a larger share of the daily distribution of XNF, while also benefiting from significant discounts on their burn fees. By bridging the communities of these exceptional NFTs, this amplified burn effect fosters unity and fuels the growth of each ecosystem, creating a win-win situation for all involved.

Here's how it works: When NFT holders decide to burn vXEN or vUSDy on Xenify, they unlock a daily burn bonus that doubles their batch count (NB). The bonus is capped at 100 daily batches per NFT ID. Once a user uses up all 100 daily bonus batches allocated to their NFT, that specific NFT will no longer offer an amplified burn for that day.

Looking for extra firepower? We've got fantastic news! By owning or renting at least 4 of these highly sought-after NFTs, you'll benefit from even greater amplification, with your wallet receiving a daily bonus of 1,000 batches. This effectively replaces the default 100 daily bonus batches reserved for each of your four NFT IDs. In short, if you hold 4 NFTs, your total daily bonus will be capped at 1,000 batches, not 1,400 batches.
Remember, the more batches you burn, the more you save on burn fees. By holding 4 NFTs, you can achieve maximum savings of 75% off your burn fees by burning just 9,000 batches during the first hour of a cycle instead of the usual 10,000. Plus, with Phoenix Ape NFTs having a limited supply of 520, there can only be a maximum of 130 wallet addresses that can seize this extra firepower.

And here's the best part: Your daily batch bonus, whether you have one NFT or four NFTs, can be seamlessly bridged to any chain that Xenify launches. Let's say Xenify expands to Polygon and you hold 4 Phoenix Ape NFTs. Once you've exhausted your daily 1,000 batch bonus on the BNB Chain, you can easily bridge the utility of your NFTs to Polygon and enjoy 1,000 bonus batches there. With your multiplier resetting every day, you'll have the opportunity to reap the benefits of this amplified burn effect across all chains Xenify launches on a daily basis!

In summary, Phoenix Ape NFT holders gain a twofold advantage. They enjoy an increased portion of the daily XNF distribution and unlock substantial discounts on the burn fee by burning a greater number of batches. However, keep in mind that the maximum limit for batches per burn transaction (NB) is set at 10,000, and the upper limit for bonus batches per burn transaction remains capped at 1,000. The burn fee discount you obtain is represented by the term (1 - (NB x BC)) in the protocols burn fee formula:

<br>

$$
BF = (FC \times VB) \times (1 - (NB \times BC))
$$

**Where:**

- $BF$ (Burn Fee) - The fee charged for the burn function, paid in the native token of the blockchain.
- $FC$ (Burn Fee Coefficient) - A time-weighted coefficient used to factor in a discount on the burn fee.
- $VB$ (Value of Batches) - The dollar value of batches being burned by the user, influencing the burn fee as the value of batches increases.
- $BC$ (Batch Coefficient) - A time-weighted coefficient used to factor in the discount based on the batches being burned.
- $NB$ (Number of Batches) - The number of batches the user burns, influencing the discount in burn fees as the number of batches increases. This will be capped at 10,000 batches.

![Grey V4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60996729/235287926-6b18081e-ca41-48c7-8dfc-29cc32c598f1.png)

## ◽️ Example: Amplified Burn Effect

Let's take a closer look at how the amplified burn works in different scenarios:

![Grey V4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60996729/235287926-6b18081e-ca41-48c7-8dfc-29cc32c598f1.png)

## ♦️ Scenario 1: If you hold between 1 and 3 Phoenix Ape NFTs, Xunicorn APEX XENFTs, or Exotic APEX XENFTs:

  - Each NFT is granted a daily bonus multiplier limited to 100 batches. When burning a specific number of batches, the protocol first verifies if any of your NFTs possess a bonus balance. If so, the protocol uses your bonus balance to increase your batch count. 

  - For instance, imagine you have a daily bonus of 100 batches on your NFT and opt to burn 10 batches. The protocol will effectively double your batch count to 20 batches, by utilising 10 of your daily bonus batches. Consequently, 10 batches from your NFT ID's daily bonus will be deducted, leaving 90 bonus batches for that NFT on that day.

  - However, if you decide to burn an amount exceeding your bonus balance, the protocol will consume the entire balance of your NFT. For example, if your current daily bonus balance is 90 batches and you choose to burn 5,000 batches, the burn process will count it as 5,090 batches, using up the entire 90 batches from your NFT's bonus balance. As a result, 90 bonus batches allocated to the NFT ID will be removed, leaving zero bonus batches for that NFT on that day. Fear not, your bonus batch count will reset to 100 the following day.

  - Additionally, you have the option to bridge your NFT's utility to another chain where Xenify has launched. By doing so, you can access an extra 100 daily bonus batches on that day, effectively granting you 200 daily bonus batches for your NFT. For example, if you've exhausted your daily bonus on the BNB Chain, simply bridge your NFT's utility to Ethereum and receive 1,000 daily bonus batches on Ethereum. This process can be repeated for each chain where Xenify has been deployed.

![Grey V4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60996729/235287926-6b18081e-ca41-48c7-8dfc-29cc32c598f1.png)

## ♦️ Scenario 2: If you hold 4 or more Phoenix Ape NFTs, Xunicorn APEX XENFTs, or Exotic APEX XENFTs:

  - If you hold 4 NFTs burning batches becomes even more rewarding. Your wallet will receive a daily bonus of 1,000 batches. This effectively replaces the default 100 daily bonus batches reserved for each of your NFT IDs. In short, if you hold 4 or more NFTs in your wallet, your total daily bonus will be capped at 1,000 batches for that wallet. When you choose to burn a batch amount that is less than your current daily bonus, the protocol will double your batch count by using an equivalent amount. 

  - For instance, if you have 4 NFTs and a daily bonus of 1,000 batches, burning 1 batch will be counted as 2 batches during the burn process. This means that 1 batch will be deducted from your daily NFTs bonus, leaving you with 999 bonus batches for the day on that chain.

  - On the other hand, if you decide to burn a batch amount greater than your current daily bonus, the protocol will utilise your entire bonus balance. Let's say you have 4 NFTs and a daily bonus of 1,000 batches. If you choose to burn the equivalent of 6,000 batches, it will be counted as 7,000 batches during the burn process. The protocol will use your entire daily batch bonus of 1,000 for this. As a result, you won't have any bonus batches remaining to use for that particular day on that chain. But don't worry, once the next day begins, your bonus batch count will reset back to 1,000.

  - Additionally, you can choose to bridge the utility of your 4 NFTs to another chain that Xenify has launched. By doing this, you can use an additional 1,000 daily bonus batches on that day, effectively giving you 2,000 daily bonus batches. For example, if you've used up your daily bonus on the BNB Chain, you can simply bridge your NFTs' utility to Ethereum and receive 1,000 daily bonus batches on Ethereum. You can repeat this process for each chain where Xenify has been deployed.

![Grey V4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60996729/235287926-6b18081e-ca41-48c7-8dfc-29cc32c598f1.png)

## ◽️ Claimable USDC Rewards

When a Phoenix Ape NFT is rented through the Xenify marketplace, a portion of the user's rental income is collected as tax. Combined with a share of royalty taxes from OpenSea, these earnings are then distributed among all Phoenix Ape NFT holders as claimable USDC rewards on the BNB Chain at the end of each 8-hour epoch.

And here's the best part: even if a user decides to bridge their Phoenix NFT from the BNB chain to amplify burns with Xenify on another chain, they'll still be eligible for the USDC distribution. In simpler terms, the claimable USDC rewards on the BNB Chain will be reserved for all addresses that hold the Phoenix Ape NFT, regardless of whether they bridge utility to another chain.

![Grey V4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60996729/235287926-6b18081e-ca41-48c7-8dfc-29cc32c598f1.png)

## ◽️ Unique Rental Mechanism
  
The Phoenix Ape NFT features a one-of-a-kind rental mechanism that empowers BNB Chain holders to rent their NFT at a predetermined USDC price for a specific duration. By opting to rent out their Phoenix Ape NFT, users actively contribute to the generation of LP tokens utilised by the YSL.IO protocol for the USDy Incentive Buyback (UIB) mechanism. This groundbreaking model not only ensures the stability of the USDy token but also plays a pivotal role in fostering the overall health of the YSL.IO ecosystem.

Moreover, Phoenix Ape NFT holders on the BNB Chain who choose not to rent out their NFT still reap the benefits of this exceptional rental mechanism. They will receive a share of the rental tax generated from users renting their Phoenix NFT on the Xenify marketplace. This tax will be combined with a portion of OpenSea’s royalty tax and distributed to all BNB Chain Phoenix Ape NFT holders as claimable USDC every 8 hours, further rewarding users for their active participation in holding this exclusive NFT.

![Grey V4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60996729/235287926-6b18081e-ca41-48c7-8dfc-29cc32c598f1.png)

## ◽️ Bypassing the Sigma Exit Rate
    
The YSL.IO protocol has been purpose-built to provide stability and resilience for all participants. The protocol showcases an innovative Price Stability Model (PSM) that not only aims to stabilise the price of native tokens (YSL, xYSL, bYSL, and USDy), but also guarantees users experience high exit liquidity and preserves the long-term growth of treasury-owned liquidity.

A crucial component of the PSM is the Sigma Exit Rate, which restricts token sales from a wallet by considering the user's acquisition or last sale of the token. However, privileged Phoenix Ape NFT holders can enjoy the freedom to sell up to 100% of their xYSL, bYSL, or USDy tokens without being subjected to the Sigma Exit Rate. This exclusive feature grants users ultimate flexibility and control over their YSL.IO native token holdings.

## ◽️ Starts at Zero Supply

- XNF will begin with a zero token supply, with tokens minted exclusively through user participation in the ecosystem. This approach guarantees that there is no possibility for a stealth launch, which often favours a select few. Instead, all participants will have equal opportunities to engage with and benefit from the protocol.

![Grey V4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60996729/235287926-6b18081e-ca41-48c7-8dfc-29cc32c598f1.png)

## ◽️ Proof of Participation

- Users will earn rewards proportional to their active engagement and contributions within the ecosystem, fostering a merit-based reward system that promotes fairness and inclusivity for all participants.

![Grey V4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60996729/235287926-6b18081e-ca41-48c7-8dfc-29cc32c598f1.png)

## ◽️ No Investor Allocation

- There will be no token allocation for privileged investors or venture capitalists, ensuring a genuinely equitable distribution of tokens among users actively engaged in the ecosystem. This strategy eliminates preferential treatment and fosters a more inclusive and fair environment for everyone involved.

## ◽️ No Initial Coin Offering

- Xenify will forego an Initial Coin Offering (ICO), reinforcing our unwavering commitment to a fair and transparent launch that ensures equal opportunities for all participants.

![Grey V4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60996729/235287926-6b18081e-ca41-48c7-8dfc-29cc32c598f1.png)

## ◽️ Users Mint Their Equity

- XNF tokens will not be pre-mined or allocated to investors or team members. Instead, users can acquire XNF tokens by actively engaging with the protocol, whether by burning vXEN or vUSDy tokens, or swapping tokens from a supported chain. This approach rewards users for their contributions and guarantees a fair distribution of XNF within the ecosystem.

![Grey V4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60996729/235287926-6b18081e-ca41-48c7-8dfc-29cc32c598f1.png)

## ◽️ Immutable Contracts (No Admin Keys)

  - Xenify's smart contracts will be carefully crafted without admin keys or centralised control, safeguarding the protocol's immutability and preserving its decentralised nature. What does this mean? Once our tokenomics and protocol architecture are deployed, they're set in stone – no upgrades or alterations can be made. This commitment to immutability delivers a stable, transparent, and secure environment for our community, ensuring that no single entity can make arbitrary decisions to manipulate the protocol.

We understand that you may have questions about Xenify, its features, and its potential. To help you navigate our platform, we've compiled a list of frequently asked questions that provide clarity and insights into Xenify and its ecosystem.

![Grey V4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60996729/235287926-6b18081e-ca41-48c7-8dfc-29cc32c598f1.png)

## ◽️ Does XNF have an initial supply?
  - No, Xenify does not have an initial supply, and there is no pre-mine of XNF tokens. Instead, the protocol rewards users on a daily basis for their active participation in the ecosystem. This is achieved through various contributions, such as burn fee contributions made by directly burning vXEN or vUSDy tokens, as well as swap fees generated through the Xenify aggregator. Notably, all burn fees and swap fees collected on supported EVM chains are directed towards XNF stakers on a daily basis, providing significant long-term earning potential.

  - By implementing this equitable distribution system, Xenify aims to create a level playing field for all users, preventing any concentration of tokens in the hands of a few early adopters. Instead, the protocol emphasizes the importance of ongoing user involvement and contributions, as they directly translate into tangible rewards. This innovative approach distinguishes Xenify as a platform that values its community and actively encourages their participation in shaping the ecosystem.

## ◽️ What does the recycle button do?
  - The recycle button is a user-friendly feature that prioritises the needs of veXNF holders. By simply clicking this button, users can conveniently convert their accumulated native chain rewards into XNF through the daily burn auction. This feature brings several advantages. Firstly, it allows you to participate in the burn cycle without incurring the mandatory mint fee and burn fee associated with the default burn process. This means you can enjoy the benefits of acquiring XNF through the burn cycle while saving on additional fees. 

  - Moreover, by choosing to recycle your rewards, you actively contribute to the growth and sustainability of the Xenify ecosystem. The protocol utilises 50% of your accrued native chain rewards to create XNF liquidity, enabling a more robust and efficient market for the token. Additionally, 25% of the rewards are used to create XEN liquidity, further enhancing the ecosystem's overall liquidity. Lastly, the remaining 25% is sent as USDC to the team, supporting ongoing operational expenses such as platform development, marketing campaigns, and community engagement activities. 

  - By recycling your rewards, you not only enhance your own benefits but also play a vital role in the continued success of the Xenify platform. As a result, recyclers will receive an additional exclusive distribution of native chain tokens generated from the platform's claim fees. This means that by actively participating in the recycling process, you have the opportunity to secure even more native chain tokens, boosting your overall holdings.

  - In conclusion, the recycle button feature not only offers convenience but also presents numerous advantages for veXNF holders. By saving on fees, contributing to ecosystem growth, and accessing exclusive distributions, recyclers can maximise their benefits while supporting the ongoing success of the Xenify platform.

## ◽️ Why will XNF appreciate in value?
  - The value of XNF holds the potential to appreciate significantly due to Xenify’s innovative tokenomics, thriving ecosystem, and the increasing demand for native chain rewards. With Xenify's cutting-edge cross-chain aggregator, users can enjoy seamless token swapping and engage in various rewarding activities, which drives protocol adoption and ultimately the value of XNF.

  - Additionally, the scarcity of XNF tokens, brought about by halving events, is likely to boost the token's value as more users choose Xenify as their preferred platform for swapping tokens. This will lead to more native chain rewards for XNF stakers, resulting in a growing demand for XNF tokens. Consequently, the token value is poised to rise due to demand, cementing Xenify's position as a promising project within the XEN ecosystem.

## ◽️ If I make a stake now when can I unstake?
  - When you choose to stake your XNF, you'll have the opportunity to select a staking cycle that suits your preferences, ranging from a minimum of 2 weeks to a maximum of 4 years. It's important to note that once you begin the staking cycle, your XNF tokens will be locked, and you won't be able to unstake them until the cycle is completed. Once your chosen staking cycle comes to an end, you'll have the freedom to unstake your XNF tokens, reclaiming full ownership and control over them. By participating in staking, you contribute to the overall health of our ecosystem, and in return, you have the opportunity to earn native chain rewards on a daily basis!

![Grey V4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60996729/235287926-6b18081e-ca41-48c7-8dfc-29cc32c598f1.png)

## ◽️ How do I generate rewards with Xenify?
  - Xenify offers users the opportunity to earn rewards like ETH, BNB, and MATIC on a daily basis by staking XNF tokens. These rewards are distributed among XNF stakers based on their veXNF balance and the power associated with their veXNF. This incentive model not only encourages active participation but also plays a vital role in fostering the long-term growth and sustainability of the protocol.

![Grey V4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60996729/235287926-6b18081e-ca41-48c7-8dfc-29cc32c598f1.png)

## ◽️ If I make a stake now when will I receive rewards?
  - When you stake XNF tokens, you will receive rewards at the end of the cycle in which you make the stake. Throughout the cycle, these rewards accumulate in a reward pool, and the protocol distributes the entire reward pool of native chain tokens among veXNF holders at the end of the cycle based on their veXNF balance and associated power, ensuring a fair and transparent distribution.

![Grey V4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60996729/235287926-6b18081e-ca41-48c7-8dfc-29cc32c598f1.png)

## ◽️ Are there different ways to participate with Xenify?
- Yes, there are several ways to participate with Xenify, including:

  - Utilise the Xenify aggregator to perform seamless single-click swaps and earn XNF in the process.
  - Engage in direct burns of vXEN or vUSDy to acquire XNF.
  - Stake XNF tokens to earn native chain tokens such as ETH, BNB and MATIC.
  - Purchase a Phoenix Ape NFT to unlock daily amplified burns and more.
  - Contribute to the protocol's growth through community initiatives.

![Grey V4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60996729/235287926-6b18081e-ca41-48c7-8dfc-29cc32c598f1.png)

## ◽️ What happens if there are no token swaps or burns during a daily cycle?

- In the unlikely event that a cycle passes without any swaps on Xenify and no users burning either vXEN or vUSDy, the daily XNF cycle distribution will not occur. The XNF tokens that were due to be distributed during this cycle won't be minted. Consequently, the overall supply of XNF will reduce by the number intended for distribution in that cycle. For instance, if the daily allocation for a cycle was set at 20,000 XNF, and no swaps or burns take place during that cycle, then these 20,000 XNF will neither be minted nor distributed. Instead, the total supply of XNF will be reduced by 20,000 XNF at the end of the cycle.

- But what if a cycle passes where only swaps are undertaken and no burns occur? Well, In this scenario, the designated daily XNF for distribution will be apportioned among the participants of the swap. For instance, if the daily allocation for a cycle is set at 20,000 XNF, and swaps are performed without any burns occurring during that cycle, then the full allocation of 20,000 XNF will be minted and distributed amongst the swap participants.

- Similarly, in a cycle where only burns are executed with no swaps taking place, the full allocation of XNF scheduled for distribution will be allotted to the participants of the burn auction. For instance, if the daily allocation for a cycle is set at 20,000 XNF, and burns are conducted without any swaps happening during that cycle, then the full allocation of 20,000 XNF will be minted and distributed amongst the participants of the burn auction.

![Grey V4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60996729/235287926-6b18081e-ca41-48c7-8dfc-29cc32c598f1.png)

## ◽️ XNF 

  - XNF is the native equity token of Xenify, a state-of-the-art cross-chain aggregator protocol in the decentralised finance (DeFi) space. Users can earn XNF tokens by actively participating in the platform's activities, such as burning vXEN or vUSDy tokens and swapping tokens on supported chains.

![Grey V4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60996729/235287926-6b18081e-ca41-48c7-8dfc-29cc32c598f1.png)

## ◽️ veXNF 

  - veXNF is a vested token, embodied as a non-fungible token (NFT) under the ERC-721 standard, representing a user's staked position in XNF. A user's share of the native chain rewards isn't solely dictated by the quantity of veXNF they possess. It's also influenced by their 'power' or standing within the protocol. This standing is determined by a combination of their veXNF holdings and the length of their lock-in period.

![Grey V4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60996729/235287926-6b18081e-ca41-48c7-8dfc-29cc32c598f1.png)

## ◽️ Xenify

  - Xenify is a decentralised finance (DeFi) protocol designed to revolutionise the token swap experience. It offers a state-of-the-art cross-chain aggregator, making it easy to swap tokens across 50 different chains.

## ◽️ Staking 

  - Staking involves locking up tokens in a wallet or platform to support network operations, like validating transactions or securing the network. In return, participants receive rewards.

![Grey V4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60996729/235287926-6b18081e-ca41-48c7-8dfc-29cc32c598f1.png)

## ◽️ Cross-chain

  - Cross-chain refers to the ability to interact with and transfer assets between different blockchain networks. It promotes interoperability and a more connected ecosystem.

![Grey V4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60996729/235287926-6b18081e-ca41-48c7-8dfc-29cc32c598f1.png)

## ◽️ Tokenomics

  - Tokenomics is the study of the economic aspects of a cryptocurrency or token, such as supply, distribution, and incentives.

![Grey V4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60996729/235287926-6b18081e-ca41-48c7-8dfc-29cc32c598f1.png)

## ◽️ Direct Burns 

  - When a token is burned it's usually sent to an inactive address and removed from circulation, effectively reducing the total supply by the amount burned. On Xenify, Direct Burns happen when users purposefully burn tokens (vXEN or vUSDy) to promote the growth of the protocol.  As a reward for their commitment to the protocol, users receive XNF tokens in exchange for their burned vXEN or vUSDy tokens.

![Grey V4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60996729/235287926-6b18081e-ca41-48c7-8dfc-29cc32c598f1.png)

## ◽️ Proof of Burn

  - Proof of Burn is a commitment mechanism where users burn tokens to show their support for the protocol. In exchange, they receive equity.

![Grey V4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60996729/235287926-6b18081e-ca41-48c7-8dfc-29cc32c598f1.png)

## ◽️ Swap Volume 
  
  - Swap volume refers to the total value of token swaps executed on the Xenify platform. It serves as the basis for distributing XNF tokens to users during the daily reward cycle.

![Grey V4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60996729/235287926-6b18081e-ca41-48c7-8dfc-29cc32c598f1.png)

## ◽️ First Principles 

  - First principles in crypto are the fundamental concepts that underpin decentralised digital currencies. They focus on permissionless access, transparency, trustlessness, decentralisation, and immutability. These principles guide the growth and innovation of cryptocurrencies, enabling informed decision-making and shaping the future of decentralised finance.

![Grey V4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60996729/235287926-6b18081e-ca41-48c7-8dfc-29cc32c598f1.png)

## ◽️ Interoperability

  - Interoperability is the ability of different systems, networks, or platforms to seamlessly work together. It allows for the exchange of data, assets, and information without barriers.

![Grey V4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60996729/235287926-6b18081e-ca41-48c7-8dfc-29cc32c598f1.png)

## ◽️ Smart Contracts 

  - Smart Contracts are digital agreements that automatically execute when specific conditions are met, allowing two or more parties to exchange things like money, property, or shares in a transparent and hassle-free way, without needing a middleman. These contracts are like mini-programs stored on a blockchain, and they run as soon as the agreed-upon terms are fulfilled. By automating the process, everyone involved can be confident in the outcome without delays or interference from intermediaries.

![Grey V4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60996729/235287926-6b18081e-ca41-48c7-8dfc-29cc32c598f1.png)

## ◽️ DeFi (Decentralised Finance) 

  - DeFi, short for Decentralised Finance, is a financial system that cuts out the middlemen by using blockchain technology. It blends traditional banking with blockchain, replacing some parts of the usual financial system with smart contracts on a blockchain. DeFi delivers financial services on a blockchain, offering a more open, transparent, and user-friendly alternative to traditional financial services.
