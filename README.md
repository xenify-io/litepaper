Welcome to Xenify! We are the Nexus of Innovation, Reward, Effortless Cross-Chain Swapping, and Community-Driven Expansion. 

Xenify stands as a cross-chain meta-aggregator of aggregators, pioneering a new era of 'Swap to Earn'. Our groundbreaking protocol seamlessly integrates inventive tokenomics and advanced cross-chain functionality into a single, powerful package. By incorporating a unique, game theory-based incentive model that actively rewards engagement, Xenify is primed to instigate a seismic shift in the world of cross-chain swapping. Our mission is clear: revolutionise the DeFi landscape by offering the best of both worlds: an ultra-efficient cross-chain swap experience and substantial opportunities for earning.

At the core of Xenify's bold vision is a cutting-edge liquidity aggregation protocol that streamlines cross-chain token swaps. Whether you want to swap tokens on Ethereum, BNB Chain, Polygon, Arbitrum, or any of the 40 supported chains, Xenify has you covered. With access to 26 different aggregators, Xenify guarantees unparalleled liquidity and optimal rates for your swaps. By leveraging cutting-edge APIs, Xenify bridges seamless communication with a wide array of DEX aggregators, dramatically enhancing the swapping experience and streamlining the quest for optimal swap routes across the vast tapestry of chains.

What sets Xenify apart from other cross-chain swapping platforms is its commitment to creating a mutually beneficial environment for all participants. By contributing to swap fees across supported EVM chains, you earn XNF tokens, while 100% of your swap fees are distributed as rewards to XNF stakers. Moreover, Xenify serves as a strategic layer 1 burner of XEN, enabling XEN holders to effortlessly convert their holdings into XNF at a predictable rate. Throughout this burn process, our unique fee-utilization algorithm guarantees that 100% of burn fees are directed as rewards to XNF stakers, while the mint fee bolsters the growth of XNF liquidity.

But that’s not all! Xenify's innovative design has enabled the seamless integration of the YSL.IO protocol, incorporating its state-of-the-art AlphaVaults and AceVaults into the daily reward distribution process.

## ◽️  Advanced Cross-chain Aggregator Capabilities

With Xenify, swapping between chains has never been more seamless and efficient, breaking down barriers and fostering a more interconnected DeFi ecosystem. A standout feature that sets Xenify apart from the rest is that we're a cross-chain meta aggregator of aggregators. While the term may sound complex, it simply means that we bring together multiple cross-chain aggregators onto a single platform. By leveraging our advanced liquidity aggregation protocol, we are able to transform the way users transition between blockchain networks.

With access to competitive rates and exceptional liquidity from 26 aggregators across 40 blockchains, our users enjoy unparalleled benefits and enhanced flexibility in managing their assets.  

![Grey V4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60996729/235287926-6b18081e-ca41-48c7-8dfc-29cc32c598f1.png)

## ◽️  Emphasis on Equity and Long-term Investment

Xenify places great emphasis on equity and long-term investments. We believe in empowering our users to reap the rewards of our protocol's growth and token value appreciation. By holding a stake in Xenify, users have the opportunity to become a part of our success and stand to potentially generate passive income through staking XNF. To accomplish this, we've developed a range of robust features designed to maximise your benefits as a Xenify user:

![Grey V4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60996729/235287926-6b18081e-ca41-48c7-8dfc-29cc32c598f1.png)

## ♦️ Staking

- Xenify introduces a dynamic staking rewards system that offers significant advantages to XNF stakers. By staking XNF tokens, users become eligible to receive an impressive 100% of burn fees and swap fees generated on supported chains, every single day. But that's not all! Through seamless integration with the YSL.IO protocol, Xenify offers an additional layer of rewards to XNF stakers. Within this framework, a complete 100% of the yield generated from the rehypothecation of YSL.IO AlphaVault assets is redirected to Xenify and shared among XNF stakers.

- Moreover, the XNF claim fees generated from the daily XNF mint reserved for the YSL.IO protocol are also included. When an AlphaVault or AceVault participant claims XNF, their claim fee is collected and distributed among XNF stakers. If vault participants decide not to claim their XNF, the unclaimed XNF is fully redistributed among XNF stakers who have recycled rewards. This fair and inclusive incentive model ensures that active participants in the ecosystem are generously rewarded, fostering a vibrant and engaged community.

![Grey V4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60996729/235287926-6b18081e-ca41-48c7-8dfc-29cc32c598f1.png)

## ♦️ Recycling

  - Recycling your native chain rewards offers a wide range of benefits and is a strategic decision to consider. By choosing to recycle your rewards, you can bypass the 25% claim fee and simultaneously boost your XNF holdings as 100% of your rewards contribute to the daily vXEN burn. This streamlined burn process is further optimised by the protocol, which mints vXEN equivalent to your rewards value while deducting the burn fee from your reward balance. This mechanism essentially allows you to participate in the daily burn auction without the need for additional native chain rewards to cover mandatory protocol and burn fees associated with the default burn process. At the end of the cycle, you will receive XNF based on the batches contributed to the burn process from your recycled rewards.

  - Moreover, leveraging the recycle function grants you exclusive access to the daily distribution of native tokens generated from the 25% claim fee. Your share of the native chain tokens is proportional to the rewards you recycle during a cycle. For instance, if $100,000 worth of native chain rewards were claimed during a cycle and you are the sole XNF staker recycling rewards, you would receive the entire $25,000 worth of native chain tokens generated from the claim fee when the cycle concludes.

  - In addition to these advantages, recyclers are eligible for an exclusive redistribution of any unclaimed XNF from the YSL.IO allocation at the end of each cycle. The redistributed XNF is made available as claimable XNF, and only XNF stakers who recycled rewards in the previous cycle qualify for this redistribution. The amount of XNF each recycler receives depends on their veXNF holdings. 

  - When users recycle rewards, their native tokens are strategically utilised to strengthen the ecosystem. 50% of the tokens are used to generate XNF liquidity, 25% is utilised to create liquidity for the XEN token variant of the chain, and the remaining 25% of native tokens are sent to the team as USDC to cover ongoing operational expenses, including platform development, marketing campaigns, and community engagement activities. This mutually beneficial arrangement rewards recyclers for their dedication and active participation in the growth of Xenify, creating a win-win situation for both the earning potential of recyclers and the advancement of the platform.

![Grey V4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60996729/235287926-6b18081e-ca41-48c7-8dfc-29cc32c598f1.png)

## ♦️ Token Burning

- Xenify empowers users to effortlessly burn their XEN tokens or YSL.IO native tokens directly from their wallets to participate in the daily burn auction. This unique burn mechanism integrates two bespoke tokens known as vXEN and vUSDy, the virtual counterparts of XEN tokens and YSL.IO native tokens, respectively. These tokens have a specific purpose - to facilitate the minting of XNF tokens through the burn process.
  
- Consequently, users can engage in the daily burn auction, regardless of the XEN token variant or YSL.IO native token they hold. This burn mechanism goes beyond simply reducing the circulating supply of XEN tokens and YSL.IO native tokens; it embodies a strategic approach that unites the YSL.IO community and the broader XEN communities across all chains, fostering a shared vision that unifies both ecosystems.

![Grey V4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60996729/235287926-6b18081e-ca41-48c7-8dfc-29cc32c598f1.png)

## ♦️ Cross-Chain Swapping

- Xenify enables users to execute seamless cross-chain swaps, making it easier than ever to exchange tokens across 40 different chains. Our streamlined process offers a new level of simplicity in cross-chain token swaps and provides access to 26 aggregators, guaranteeing the most competitive rates available, while delivering an efficient and rewarding experience like never before. 

- But here’s the best part: One of the unique advantages of using Xenify is that every time users pay the 0.5% swap fee on chains where XNF is deployed, they are rewarded with XNF tokens through a daily swap auction. This means that users can enjoy an effortless swapping experience while also accumulating XNF tokens.

- And the rewards don't stop there, as users can take advantage of the opportunity to earn additional daily rewards such as BNB, ETH, and MATIC by simply staking their XNF tokens. Xenify truly revolutionises the cross-chain swapping process; offering users simplicity, competitive rates, and a rewarding experience.

![Grey V4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60996729/235287926-6b18081e-ca41-48c7-8dfc-29cc32c598f1.png)

## ♦️ Fair Equity Distribution

- Xenify is dedicated to promoting fairness and transparency in the distribution of equity among its users. Our unique tokenomics and staking model are designed to reward active participants and long-term holders, creating a strong incentive for users to contribute to the growth of our ecosystem. As our community continues to grow, the equitable distribution of rewards and XNF tokens ensures that everyone benefits, promoting a vibrant and engaged community. Xenify's commitment to fairness and equity fosters trust within the ecosystem, promoting a sustainable and inclusive environment for all participants.

# ◽️ XEN Overview 
![Line Divider - Filled](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60996729/233879462-b465c484-4c2f-4cd2-a126-19529e333d64.png)

XEN is a project that was launched on the principles of self-custody, trustless consensus, and decentralisation. It is a joint effort of several blockchain enthusiasts who aim to create a fairer, more transparent mining ecosystem.

One of the main goals of XEN is to democratise mining by providing a decentralised platform that allows anyone to participate in the mining process. This is achieved by utilising a Proof-of-Work (PoW) consensus algorithm that is resistant to ASIC mining, thus ensuring that the network remains accessible to individual miners.

In addition to its mining capabilities, XEN also features a native cryptocurrency, XEN token, which is used to incentivise miners and maintain the security of the network. XEN tokens are also used to pay for transaction fees and other network services.

XEN operates on a Proof of Participation (PoP) system, which allows participants to mint their coins. The XEN smart contract employs a fair distribution system based on reward time locks and the total number of participants. XEN's value is linked to its difficulty to be minted, similar to Bitcoin. As more participants join and mint XEN, the total amount of generated XEN drops, making it more scarce and valuable.

One of the key features of XEN is its simplicity, as it is based on the ERC20 token standard with minimal code, no pre-minting, hidden doors, admin keys, or origin wallets. Furthermore, XEN has a supply of zero and can only be minted by the participating community. This makes it inflationary at the beginning and disinflationary as adoption increases. XEN is immutable and has no backing by investors or intrinsic value.

To mint XEN, participants can connect their Ethereum-compatible wallets to the XEN smart contract and specify the number of days they are willing to wait to receive XEN. The smart contract generates a XEN rank (cRANK) based on how many people interacted with the contract before the participant. Participants can also stake XEN for 1 to 1,000 days, with APY rewards starting at 20% on XEN Genesis and decreasing by 1 percentage point every 90 days until it reaches 2%, where it will remain indefinitely.

Overall, XEN represents an innovative approach to mining that emphasises decentralisation, accessibility, and sustainability. XEN's combination of features, simplicity and fairness make it a unique and promising project in the crypto space.

![Grey V4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60996729/235287926-6b18081e-ca41-48c7-8dfc-29cc32c598f1.png)

## ♦️ Unifying the Chains (vXEN)

Introducing vXEN, a groundbreaking solution by Xenify that enables seamless burning of XEN across all chains, unifying the XEN communities across chains and supporting the token's deflationary nature. This innovative approach has been made possible through the integration of both Axelar and LayerZero, decentralised protocols that break down barriers between cross-chain communication with their comprehensive protocol suites.

Thanks to vXEN, you don't need to have native XEN tokens on the Ethereum network to take part in Xenify's burn process and get your hands on XNF. Instead, Xenify makes it easy for users in the broader XEN community to acquire XNF by simply burning their native XEN tokens from various EVM-compatible networks, right from their wallets.

This forward-thinking approach stems from Xenify's shared commitment to the interoperability of the XEN ecosystem and the vision of making Xenify accessible to XEN communities on multiple chains. As a result, vXEN enables Xenify to seamlessly interact with any chain supported by the XEN ecosystem, positioning itself as a strategic layer 1 burner of XEN. This ensures every user burning any XEN token variant on Xenify gets rightfully included in the burn record for the X1 distribution – the native token of the new XEN Layer 1 (X1 Chain).

vXEN can be thought of as the virtual counterpart of XEN tokens, designed specifically to simplify the process of converting various versions of XEN tokens into XNF tokens. It's important to note that you'll need XEN tokens or a XEN token variant supported by Xenify, like bXEN on the BNB Chain, to obtain vXEN. Once you have vXEN, you can burn it to join Xenify's daily distribution of XNF tokens.

And here's the best part: Xenify has implemented a fixed rate for vXEN, where one vXEN is equivalent to $1.00, and one batch is equivalent to 5 vXEN. This simplifies the entire burn process and eliminates the need for continual calculations of XEN per batch. Moreover, our burn function leverages Chainlink to ensure the conversion rate for all XEN token variants will be based on their current market value, which guarantees you always receive the full value for your native XEN tokens.

By integrating both Axelar and LayerZero, Xenify is not only enhancing cross-chain transfers but also ensuring a more robust and efficient ecosystem for the XEN community. This strategic integration fosters a more inclusive and interconnected ecosystem. This approach aligns with Xenify's commitment to interoperability, enabling seamless interaction across multiple chains and enhancing the overall user experience within the XEN ecosystem.

# ◽️ USDy Overview 
![Line Divider - Filled](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60996729/233879462-b465c484-4c2f-4cd2-a126-19529e333d64.png)

USDy is a reward token that incentivises participation in the YSL.IO ecosystem with stability and sustainability at its core. Developed with cutting-edge tokenomincs, the YSL.IO protocol boasts a host of innovative features that make USDy a standout reward token in the DeFi landscape.

One of the key highlights of USDy is its Price Stability Model (PSM), which ensures a continuous increase in liquidity, even in the face of sell pressure. The protocol achieves this through a combination of autonomous Treasury-Owned Liquidity creation and an ingenious Buyback and Burn feature (UBB), which actively works to stabilise the price of USDy.

Here's how it works: the UBB is activated every 4-epochs if the USDy pool price falls below $0.95. During this time, a portion of the tax from every trade of YSL, xYSL, bYSL, and USDy will be used to purchase and/or burn USDy. Additionally, 15% of every HydraVault deposit will also be used to purchase and burn USDy.

What's more, the protocol generates Treasury-Owned Liquidity for USDy at every point of user interaction, ensuring that as more users join the YSL.IO ecosystem, USDy's liquidity grows autonomously. And to further reduce the supply of USDy and increase its price, the Incentive Buyback mechanism (UIB) kicks in every time someone purchases the YSL token. This mechanism incorporates a 25% incentive to purchase YSL while actively reducing the supply of USDy.

Here's how it works: all of the USDC sent will be used to purchase and burn USDy equivalent to 175%, and as a bonus, users receive a complimentary 25% USDy for each purchase. The result is a reduction in USDy supply and an increase in its price, benefiting USDy holders.

In conclusion, USDy has been carefully crafted by YSL.IO with a focus on price stability, and liquidity growth. With innovative features like UBB and UIB, USDy liquidity will continue to grow autonomously while its price remains stable, creating a sustainable, less volatile, and more robust ecosystem.

## ♦️ Unifying the YSL.IO Ecosystem (vUSDy)

Introducing vUSDy, another groundbreaking solution by Xenify that enables seamless burning of YSL.IO native tokens, thereby unifying the YSL.IO ecosystem and supporting the protocol's cutting-edge Price Stability Model for its native tokens.

This innovative approach to token burning has been made possible through the integration of both Axelar and LayerZero, decentralised protocols that break down barriers between cross-chain communication with their comprehensive protocol suites.

Similar to vXEN, users are not obligated to possess the native XEN token on the Ethereum network in order to participate in Xenify's burn process and acquire XNF. Instead, Xenify empowers users within the YSL.IO ecosystem to effortlessly burn their YSL.IO native tokens directly from their wallets and acquire XNF.

This solution truly reflects Xenify's dedication to interoperability, by expanding the protocol's scope and unlocking endless possibilities through the strategic unification of the XEN and YSL.IO ecosystems, fostering a shared vision that brings both communities together.

vUSDy can be regarded as the virtual counterpart of YSL.IO's reward token, known as USDy. The sole purpose of vUSDy is to facilitate the conversion of YSL.IO native token variants into XNF tokens. It's important to note that acquiring vUSDy requires USDy tokens or a YSL.IO token variant supported by Xenify, such as bYSL or xYSL.

Once you possess vUSDy, you can burn it to participate in Xenify's daily distribution of XNF tokens. With each YSL.IO token variant having a fixed conversion rate, it eliminates the guesswork from determining how much XEN you're required to burn as a batch. In other words, users can always have confidence in the amount of vUSDy they will obtain when burning their YSL.IO native tokens. Please bear in mind that although the conversion rate for vUSDy remains fixed, it will vary depending on the specific YSL.IO native token you choose to exchange, as outlined in the table below:

<br>

| Native Token        | Conversion Rate      |
|---------------------|----------------------|
| USDy                | 1 USDy = 1 vUSDy     |
| bYSL                | 1 bYSL = 5 vUSDy     |
| xYSL                | 1 xYSL = 120 vUSDy   |

Introducing Xenify, the ultimate cross-chain aggregator of aggregators! Expertly designed to streamline the swapping process for users traversing multiple chains, Xenify offers unmatched capabilities. Powered by an advanced liquidity aggregation protocol, Xenify connects to 26 different aggregators, delivering exceptional liquidity and unbeatable rates across 40 leading chains. Whether you want to swap tokens between Ethereum, BNB Chain, Polygon, or many others, Xenify makes it effortless and rewarding!

Imagine this scenario: you want to trade Token-A on Ethereum for Token-B on BNB Chain. With Xenify, all it takes is a single click and a single transaction on Ethereum. No more hassle of navigating different chains or searching for the best rates – Xenify takes care of everything, providing you with the most favourable rates available. But there's more to Xenify than just cross-chain swaps; It's a meticulously designed ecosystem with unique tokenomics, incorporating a groundbreaking incentive model that benefits all participants. 

Xenify's built-in swap fee mechanism creates a reciprocal environment that rewards platform users with XNF as part of the daily reward cycle, and XNF stakers with 100% of swap fees generated across supported chains. On chains where XNF has yet to be deployed, the swap fee is utilised by the team to promote and enhance the Xenify platform and its associated tokens, ensuring widespread awareness and adoption.

Here's how it works: When you pay the 0.5% swap fee to execute a swap on supported EVM chains where XNF has been deployed, you not only facilitate your transaction but also secure a position in the daily XNF reward cycle for that chain. At the end of each day, 100% of the swap fee is distributed as native chain rewards to staked XNF holders on that specific chain. This means you not only earn XNF tokens based on your swap fee contribution but also reward XNF stakers with native chain tokens. It's a win-win situation for everyone involved.

What's more, Xenify incorporates an ingenious burn mechanism that enables users to burn XEN and USDy tokens to mint XNF. The XEN burning process acts as a strategic layer 1 burner, and here's the exciting part – 100% of the burn fees go back to XNF stakers. This approach not only encourages long-term user engagement but also enhances rewards for those deeply involved with the protocol.

In addition to the swap and burn fees, XNF stakers also benefit from Xenify's strategic integration of the YSL.IO protocol. This integration rewards XNF stakers with yields generated from the rehypothecation of assets deposited in YSL.IO's AlphaVaults. It also includes claim fees generated from the daily XNF allocation set aside for the YSL.IO protocol. AlphaVault and AceVault participants can choose to claim their XNF allocation. Every time a vault participant claims XNF, their claim fee is collected and distributed among XNF stakers. If participants decide to forgo the XNF allocation, 100% of the unclaimed XNF is redistributed among XNF stakers that have recycled rewards. This additional layer of utility ensures that XNF stakers are duly rewarded and fosters a mutually beneficial relationship between both protocols.

Xenify's innovative approach to staking and rewards, combined with its unique tokenomics model, creates a thoughtfully designed ecosystem that benefits all participants. Whether you're executing cross-chain token swaps or burning tokens to mint XNF, every action you take on the Xenify platform contributes to a reciprocal environment of rewards and engagement. You not only enjoy unparalleled efficiency when swapping tokens across 40 leading chains but also have the opportunity to earn native chain tokens daily and be part of a thriving community. Xenify truly offers the best of both worlds: effortless cross-chain token swapping and significant earning potential.

Xenifiy is a groundbreaking protocol that champions fairness, sustainability, and user engagement. At the heart of its tokenomics structure lies XNF, the platform's native token. XNF serves as the primary incentive for users, with a limited supply of 22.6 million. By engaging in a multitude of protocol activities such as burning, staking and swapping tokens, users are rewarded, fostering a dynamic ecosystem where benefits accrue based on contributions and involvement. With this thoughtful design, Xenify guarantees a level playing field for all users, creating an environment where everyone can reap the rewards and laying the foundation for an equitable, community-driven platform.

![Grey V4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60996729/235287926-6b18081e-ca41-48c7-8dfc-29cc32c598f1.png)

## ◽️ Token Supply

XNF is the lifeblood of the Xenify protocol, and features a limited total supply of 22.6 million tokens. The distribution process for XNF is designed with transparency and equity in mind, ensuring a level playing field for all. With no pre-mines, investor allocations, founder allocations, or team allocations, the Xenify protocol fosters an environment of fairness and inclusivity. Users have the opportunity to earn XNF equity by engaging in various activities, such as burning vXEN or vUSDy tokens and swapping tokens across supported chains. This unique token supply model not only promotes active participation but also cultivates a thriving, community-focused ecosystem that everyone can be a part of.

## ◽️ Supply Distribution

With a total supply capped at 22.6 million XNF tokens, strategically divided into three core segments for the Genesis Chain, Xenify has been purposefully designed to reward active participants while promoting a balanced ecosystem:

- **21,000,000 XNF assigned for the daily auctions:** Users that participate in various activities that bolster the ongoing development of the protocol will have the chance to earn a share of the XNF tokens dedicated to the daily auctions.

  - 10,500,000 XNF (50%) of the daily auction is distributed to users that perform direct burns of vXEN and vUSDy. During each cycle, if no one initiates the burn process, the corresponding XNF allocation will not be minted. This scarcity-driven mechanism decreases the total supply of XNF, contributing to its potential value increase.

  - 10,500,000 XNF (50%) of the daily auction is distributed to users who engage in swaps on supported EVM chains. If no swaps occur during a cycle, the corresponding XNF allocation will not be minted. This, too, reduces the total supply of XNF, enhancing its scarcity and potential value.

  - On the Genesis Chain, a daily mint of 5,250,000 XNF is reserved for the YSL.IO protocol. This amount is divided between AlphaVaults (15%) and AceVaults (10%). In order to access the XNF tokens, participants must provide native chain tokens as a claim fee. This fee, depending on the user's action, will be utilised to reward XNF stakers. Any XNF that remains unclaimed at the end of each daily cycle will be redistributed to recyclers. The rest of the 5,250,000 XNF goes to a daily auction and is distributed to users who engage in swaps on supported EVM chains.

- **100,000 XNF assigned for XNF liquidity creation:** To facilitate this, we have set aside 50,000 XNF for the vXEN Mint Fee Manager and an additional 50,000 XNF for the vUSDy Mint Fee Manager. Each time a user participates in the daily burn of vXEN or vUSDy they will be contributing to the proliferation of XNF liquidity. This initiative bolsters the overall health of the protocol and fosters a robust liquidity pool for our community.

- **1,500,000 XNF assigned as an exclusive airdrop for swap participants:** To encourage engagement and bolster liquidity, each chain will have an exclusive airdrop of 1,500,000 XNF for users that perform swaps before the deployment of XNF. The airdrop will take place on the first day of launch, and will be distributed as locked tokens, gradually unlocking over 730 days.

Drawing inspiration from Bitcoin, Xenify's distribution model adopts the halving principle. As illustrated in the accompanying graph below, following the 7th halving, the rate of Xenify's daily mint allocation stabilises, ensuring a consistent output of 156.25 XNF tokens per day until the maximum supply is reached in month 2112. This innovative strategy has been thoughtfully engineered to ensure an equitable supply distribution centred around long-term user participation, highlighting Xenify's unwavering commitment to fostering a balanced ecosystem and an engaged community.

## ◽️ XNF Minting Process and Incentives

The minting process for XNF has been meticulously designed to reward users who actively contribute to Xenify's growth through various activities. This approach promotes an equitable distribution of XNF tokens, cultivating a truly decentralised and community-driven protocol.

Likewise, Xenify's incentive structure has been carefully crafted to motivate users to actively participate in the protocol's growth. Users who engage more with the platform receive a proportionate share of the newly minted XNF tokens, fueling further involvement.

XNF tokens are distributed in one-day cycles, with the reward pool commencing at 20,000 XNF tokens. This daily mint allocation is divided into four categories on the Genesis Chain: 50% is distributed to users who burn vXEN or vUSDy tokens, 25% is distributed to users that contributed through the platform's swap fee, 15% reserved as claimable XNF for the YSL.IO AlphaVaults and the remaining 10% reserved as claimable XNF for the YSL.IO AceVaults. For all other chains, the daily mint allocation is divided into two categories: 50% is distributed to users who burn vXEN or vUSDy tokens, and 50% is distributed to users that contributed through the platform's swap fee. With the halving model in place, the daily mint allocation diminishes over time and ultimately leads to the complete distribution of the 22.6 million XNF tokens in month 2112.

Staking XNF tokens allows users to accumulate rewards in the form of native tokens specific to the chain they are on, such as MATIC on Polygon. These rewards are generated through a variety of mechanisms that have been integrated with the protocol, including swap fees, burn fees, and Xenify's strategic integration of the YSL.IO protocol. 

This innovative three-pronged incentive model will not only help incentivise more users to utilise Xenify to acquire XNF, but their engagement will actively reward XNF stakes. Ultimately, this approach creates a flywheel effect, supporting the long-term growth of Xenify while cultivating a dynamic and sustainable reward system that incentivises a continuously expanding user base.

![Grey V4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60996729/235287926-6b18081e-ca41-48c7-8dfc-29cc32c598f1.png)

## ♦️ Burn to earn XNF 

  - Xenify empowers users to effortlessly burn their XEN tokens or YSL.IO native tokens directly from their wallets to participate in the daily burn auction. This unique burn mechanism integrates two bespoke tokens known as vXEN and vUSDy, the virtual counterparts of XEN tokens and YSL.IO native tokens, respectively. These tokens have a specific purpose - to facilitate the minting of XNF tokens through the burn process.

  - Consequently, users can engage in the daily burn auction, regardless of the variant of XEN token or YSL.IO variant they possess. This burn mechanism goes beyond simply reducing the circulating supply of XEN tokens and YSL.IO native tokens; it embodies a strategic approach that brings together the YSL.IO community and the broader XEN communities across all chains, fostering a shared vision that unifies both ecosystems.

  - It is important to note that acquiring vXEN requires XEN tokens or a XEN token variant supported by Xenify, such as bXEN on the BNB Chain. The burn function positions the protocol as a key player in the strategic layer 1 burning of XEN tokens. As a result, every time you burn your XEN native token variant, your address will be added to the X1 burn record, and in return, you'll acquire vXEN. Please keep in mind that executing the burning process of your XEN tokens will incur a mint fee and burn fee. However, once you possess vXEN, you can participate in Xenify's daily distribution of XNF tokens without any associated fees. During this burn process, both the XEN token variant and the provided vXEN will be permanently removed from circulation, with the burn fee being rewarded to XNF stakers and the mint fee utilised to create XNF and XEN liquidity. The amount of vXEN batches obtained from the burn process will vary based on the current market value of the specific XEN token variant you choose to burn.

  - Likewise, holders of YSL.IO native tokens (bYSL, xYSL, or USDy) can actively engage in the daily burn auction by acquiring vUSDy. Similar to the XEN burning process, executing the burning of your YSL.IO native tokens will require a mint fee and burn fee. Once you have acquired vUSDy, you can participate in Xenify's daily distribution of XNF tokens without any associated fees. This burn process will permanently remove 100% of the YSL.IO token variant and vUSDy provided from circulation, with the burn fee being rewarded to XNF stakers and the mint fee utilised to create XNF and USDy liquidity. It's important to note that the conversion rate for vUSDy remains fixed, but it depends on the specific YSL.IO native token you choose to exchange.

## ♦️ Swap to earn XNF 

  - Xenify is redefining the game with a groundbreaking platform that enables seamless single-click cross-chain transactions across 40 chains, while providing stakers the exciting opportunity to earn native chain tokens daily.

  - Every time users pay the 0.5% swap fee on chains where XNF has been deployed, they are rewarded with XNF tokens through the daily swap auction. This unique advantage enables users to enjoy an effortless swapping experience while simultaneously accumulating XNF tokens.

  - But, the rewards don't stop there. By staking these XNF tokens, users have the opportunity to rake in native chain tokens like BNB, ETH, and MATIC on a daily basis. These native chain rewards stem from multiple sources, including swap fees, burn fees, rehypothecation of YSL.IO AlphaVault assets, and claim fees produced by the YSL.IO protocol. As a result, users can not only enjoy the efficiency and competitive rates Xenify offers but also gain access to a dynamic and sustainable reward system that enhances their portfolio.

  - By participating in token swaps with Xenify, users play a pivotal role in driving the platform's growth. The swap fees generated on chains where XNF has been deployed are distributed among the XNF stakers on that specific chain. For chains where XNF is yet to be deployed, the swap fees are utilised by the team to support promotional efforts and advance the development of Xenify and its affiliated tokens. This fosters greater awareness and wider adoption of the platform, benefiting the entire community.

  - Moreover, by engaging in swaps on any of the 40 supported chains, users become eligible for an exclusive airdrop of 1,500,000 XNF. Each airdrop event takes place on a chain where XNF is scheduled to be deployed and lasts for 60 days before the launch. All swaps conducted during this period guarantee users a share of the upcoming XNF airdrop. In other words, even though you don’t benefit from a daily XNF allocation when you execute swaps on chains where XNF hasn’t been deployed, you still have the opportunity to be included in an exclusive XNF airdrop. 

  - All native tokens accrued from the 0.5% swap fee on the chain where the 60-day airdrop event takes place are accumulated and set aside for the Day 1 reward distribution to XNF stakers on that specific chain. For instance, prior to the Genesis launch on BNB Chain, there will be a 60-day airdrop event prior to the deployment of XNF, with all BNB generated from swap fees during this period reserved for the initial reward distribution for XNF stakers on BNB Chain.

## ♦️ Stake XNF to earn native tokens 

  - Distinguishing itself from generic aggregators, Xenify takes pride in its avant-garde incentive model that empowers platform users to execute seamless swaps and embark on a rewarding journey by earning rewards every cycle based on their staked XNF. These rewards are distributed in the form of native chain tokens—a highly liquid asset—signalling a potentially lucrative return for users who stake XNF.

  - XNF stakers play an essential role in Xenify's long-term growth, and in return reap the benefits. For chains where XNF has been deployed, stakers enjoy native tokens generated from swap fees across all supported EVM chains at the end of each cycle. As Xenify continues to broaden its reach, an increasing amount of swap volume is guaranteed, with users eager to benefit from a seamless swapping experience while earning XNF on every swap they make. Consequently, XNF stakers benefit from increased rewards! This equitable model establishes a positive feedback loop, guaranteeing all participants benefit from the ecosystem’s growth proportional to their engagement.

  - In addition to swap fees, XNF stakers on chains where XNF has been deployed, will also earn native tokens at the end of each cycle generated from the burn fee. With XNF adopting the halving model and 50% of the daily mint reserved for those burning vXEN and vUSDy, participating in the daily burn auction is one of the few means to securing a sizable XNF position. As more users burn vXEN and vUSDy to acquire XNF, not only do XNF stakers profit from increased rewards through the burn fee, but XNF liquidity proliferates via the mint fee. This innovative burn cycle implementation creates another positive feedback loop, ensuring the entire ecosystem benefits from user engagement.

  - But that's not all! XNF stakers will also benefit from Xenify's strategic integration of YSL.IO and its AlphaVaults and AceVaults. This secondary layer of Xenify's reward framework will provide native tokens to XNF stakers from the yield derived from the rehypothecation of AlphaVault assets, as well as the claim fees generated from the daily XNF allocation set aside for the YSL.IO protocol. AlphaVault and AceVault participants can decide to claim either their XNF allocation or USDy tokens—but not both. Every time a vault participant claims XNF, their claim fee is collected and distributed among XNF stakers at the cycle's conclusion.

  - Xenify's innovative staking model enables users to stake their XNF tokens for an opportunity to receive a steady stream of exceptional rewards in the form of Native Chain Rewards. This distinctive rewards distribution model not only strengthens demand and value for XNF, but also serves as an added incentive for holders to stake their daily XNF distributions. This strategy has been integrated to encourage long-term engagement with the protocol, while cultivating an ever-expanding user base.

## ◽️ Costs of Swapping on Xenify

Xenify offers a groundbreaking token swap solution that not only simplifies cross-chain transactions but also rewards its users, all the while nurturing the expansion of its ecosystem. Through a 0.5% fee on every token swap, Xenify is able to achieve three crucial objectives: reward its platform users with XNF tokens, provide native chain rewards to XNF stakers, and ensure the continuous development of the protocol.

Here's how it works: When a user initiates a token swap on Xenify, they pay a 0.5% swap fee. This fee is strategically allocated to encourage future growth and incentivize user engagement. On chains where XNF has been deployed or airdrop events are happening, 100% of the swap fee will be distributed as rewards among XNF stakers in the form of native chain tokens. For all other chains, the swap fee will be allocated to the team to bolster Xenify's ongoing development, marketing, and outreach efforts.

But here's the exciting part, by paying the nominal 0.5% swap fee on chains where XNF is deployed, you not only expedite your transaction but also secure an allocation of XNF from the protocol's daily mint cycle. These XNF tokens can be staked to unlock even greater gains from the native tokens distributed at the end of each daily cycle. As a result, platform users benefit from Xenify's efficiency and competitive rates, while earning rewards and actively shaping the evolution of Xenify's dynamic ecosystem.

![Grey V4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60996729/235287926-6b18081e-ca41-48c7-8dfc-29cc32c598f1.png)

## ◽️ Costs of Burning on Xenify

The Xenify protocol enables users to burn vXEN or vUSDy tokens to secure XNF from the daily XNF reward cycle. Think of vXEN and vUSDy as virtual counterparts of XEN and USDy, respectively. These tokens have been specifically created for seamless conversion into XNF.

By participating in the burn process to acquire vXEN and vUSDy, users will encounter certain costs such as transaction gas fees and the mandatory mint fee and burn fee. However, the mint fee and burn fee calculations have been carefully designed to not only ensure a transparent and consistent method for token burning but also reward users with attractive discounts on their burn fees of up to 75%.

The burn fee calculation is designed to consider various factors, including the timing of the burn during a cycle, the number of batches being burned, and their associated value. The best part? The more batches a user burns, the greater the discount they'll enjoy, with potential savings of up to 75% off for 10,000 batches during the first hour of every cycle. This creates an attractive incentive for users to undertake larger burn operations at earlier points in a cycle. 

By implementing this calculation, we ensure that users receive discounts in proportion to the volume of a specific token (vXEN or vUSDy) they burn. Furthermore, we are proud to emphasise that 100% of the burn fees collected are directed toward XNF stakers, and the mint fee will be redeployed to bolster liquidity. This approach not only encourages efficiency but also rewards our valuable contributors, establishing a mutually beneficial ecosystem. Plus, with the maximum discount of 75% for 10,000 batches, the more users burn, the more they save! This exciting prospect not only offers substantial benefits for those who burn but also generates enhanced rewards for XNF stakers. 

But what exactly is a batch? A batch represents a fixed number of tokens, either vXEN or vUSDy, required to participate in the burn process. A single batch for vXEN is set at a fixed amount of 5 vXEN, with the value per vXEN token being fixed at $1.00. Similarly, a single batch for vUSDy is set at a fixed amount of 5 vUSDy, with the value per vUSDy token being fixed at $1.00. The amount of XEN token variant needed to acquire a batch of vXEN will be dynamic, adapting to the ever-changing market price of each XEN token variant. However, the amount of YSL.IO token variant needed to acquire a batch of vUSDy will be fixed, varying based on the specific YSL.IO token being burned.

To obtain vXEN, you simply need to hold a supported XEN token variant and a sufficient amount of native chain tokens to cover the mandatory mint fee and burn fee. 100% of the XEN token variant you provide will be burned, ensuring your wallet address is included in the burn record for the distribution of X1 - the native token of the new XEN Layer 1 (X1 Chain). 

Just bear in mind that the value of vXEN is fixed at $1.00, with 1 vXEN equal to $1.00 XEN (and XEN token variant) based on its current market value. This means that the required amount for each burn is tailored to the current market value of the specific XEN token variant you're burning, ensuring a fair exchange for all users. For instance, if the current price of bXEN is $0.01, and you hold 10,000 bXEN, the protocol will determine your 10,000 bXEN as equivalent to $100 vXEN (100 vXEN tokens). 

Similarly, if you want to acquire vUSDy, you'll need to have YSL.IO native tokens such as bYSL, xYSL, or USDy. Keep in mind that when you burn for vUSDy, the protocol will use predetermined rates to convert bYSL, xYSL, and USDy. Also, like acquiring vXEN, when you burn USDy, xYSL, or bYSL for vUSDy, you will need to pay a mint fee of an equivalent value. This means that when you burn xYSL, bYSL, or USDy for vUSDy, you will need to cover the transaction gas fees and the mint fee, ensuring a fair and consistent process across all token types.

![Grey V4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60996729/235287926-6b18081e-ca41-48c7-8dfc-29cc32c598f1.png)

## ◽️ Time-Weighted Burn Fee Discount

Xenify introduces an innovative approach to burn fee discounts that aims to promote fairness and prevent manipulation. By implementing a carefully designed burn fee calculation, the protocol effectively curbs unfair practices where users strategically time transactions to maximise their rewards or incentives.

The Burn Fee (BF) calculation includes time-weighted factors called Burn Fee Coefficient (FC) and Batch Coefficient (BC), which help determine the fee needed to execute the burn function based on the value of batches being burned. The burn fee discount that you obtain will be dependent on the Burn Fee Coefficient (FC) and the Batch Coefficient (BC) that is applicable at the time of burning. Both coefficients are time-weighted, decreasing throughout the daily cycle. This means the effective discount that you obtain will vary depending on when you decide to burn during a cycle. 

To initiate the burn function on Xenify, users must have a sufficient wallet balance of native chain tokens that meets or exceeds the amount required for the Mint Fee and Burn Fee. The mint fee that a user is required to send will be dependent on the underlying market value of the tokens being burned by the user, and the protocol will calculate the Burn Fee (BF) using the formula below:

<br>

$$
BF = (FC \times VB) \times (1 - (NB \times BC))
$$

**Where:**

- $BF$ (Burn Fee) - The fee charged for the burn function, paid in the native token of the blockchain.
- $FC$ (Burn Fee Coefficient) - A time-weighted coefficient used to factor in a discount on the burn fee.
- $VB$ (Value of Batches) - The dollar value of batches being burned by the user, influencing the burn fee as the value of batches increases.
- $BC$ (Batch Coefficient) - A time-weighted coefficient used to factor in the discount based on the batches being burned.
- $NB$ (Number of Batches) - The number of batches the user burns, influencing the discount in burn fees as the number of batches increases. This will be capped at 10,000 batches.

<br>

It's worth noting that the burn fee discount you receive will depend on the current values of the Burn Fee Coefficient (FC) and the Batch Coefficient (BC) at the time of burning. As these coefficients decrease throughout the daily cycle, the effective discount you obtain will vary depending on when you decide to burn during a cycle. This dynamic approach ensures that users have an opportunity to benefit from different discount levels based on their timing.

Xenify's approach to burn fee discounts not only promotes fairness but also provides users with the potential to optimise their savings. By considering the time-weighted coefficients and strategically choosing when to execute burns, users can maximise their discounts and overall value. This innovative approach brings transparency, fairness, and increased benefits to all participants of the Xenify ecosystem.


![Grey V4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60996729/235287926-6b18081e-ca41-48c7-8dfc-29cc32c598f1.png)

## ◽️ Burn Fee Coefficient (FC)

The Burn Fee (BF) needed to execute the burn function will increase as the total value of batches being burned increases, however by executing burns earlier in the cycle users have the opportunity to benefit from a lower burn fee thanks to the Burn Fee Coefficient (FC). 

As illustrated in the table below, the Burn Fee Coefficient starts at 50% when a cycle begins and increases by approximately 2.174% every hour until it reaches 100% in the final hour of the daily cycle. This means that users will need to contribute more to execute the burn function as the day goes on. However, it also provides an opportunity for users who burn earlier in the cycle to get a discount of up to 75% during the first hour of each cycle. 

<br>

| Hour | Burn Fee Coefficient (FC) |
|------|---------------------------|
| 1    | 50.00%                    |
| 2    | 52.17%                    |
| 3    | 54.35%                    |

## ◽️ Batch Coefficient (BC)

The Batch Coefficient (BC) factors in a discount on the burn fee based on the number of batches you burn. The more batches you burn, the greater the batch discount, represented by the term (1 - (NB x BC)). The value of the Batch Coefficient (BC) varies depending on when a user decides to burn during a cycle. 

The table below illustrates how the value of the coefficient changes during a 24-hour cycle. The constant starts at 0.00005 when the cycle begins and decreases by 0.0000025 every hour until it reaches zero after 20 hours. As a result, users will not benefit from the batch discount during the last four hours of the cycle.

<br>

## ◽️ Different Scenarios

Let's take a closer look at how the Batch Coefficient (BC) operates in different scenarios:

![Grey V4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60996729/235287926-6b18081e-ca41-48c7-8dfc-29cc32c598f1.png)

## ♦️ Scenario 1: User burns during Hour-1 of a cycle

  - Let’s say you decide to burn 10,000 batches valued at $5,000 during the first hour of the daily cycle. Taking into account that the Batch Coefficient (BC) during the first hour of a cycle is 0.00005 and the Burn Fee Coefficient (FC) during the first hour is 50%, the protocol will determine your Burn Fee (BF) as $1,250.

<br>

$$
BF = (0.5 \times 5,000) \times (1 - (10,000 \times 0.00005)) = $1,250
$$

<br>

![Grey V4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60996729/235287926-6b18081e-ca41-48c7-8dfc-29cc32c598f1.png)

## ♦️ Scenario 2: User burns during Hour-24 of a cycle

  - Now, let’s say you decide to burn 10,000 batches during the last hour of the daily cycle. Taking into account that the Batch Coefficient (BC) during the last hour of a cycle is 0 and the Burn Fee Coefficient (FC) during the last hour is 100%, the protocol will determine your Burn Fee (BF) as $5,000.

<br>

$$
BF = (1 \times 5,000) \times (1 - (10,000 \times 0)) = $5,000
$$

<br>

Comparing these scenarios highlights the benefits of burning batches in the first hour versus the final hour. The maximum savings of 75% are only possible if you burn 10,000 batches during the first hour of the daily cycle. This time-weighted burn fee mechanism mitigates unfair practices and enhances fairness, rewarding users who execute larger burns earlier in the cycle with greater discounts.

![Grey V4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60996729/235287926-6b18081e-ca41-48c7-8dfc-29cc32c598f1.png)

## ◽️ Mint Fee Manager

To execute the burn function on Xenify, users must have a sufficient balance of native chain tokens in their wallet to cover the Mint Fee and Burn Fee. The mint fee that a user is required to provide will depend on the market value of the tokens being burned. 100% of the native chain tokens that a user provides for the mint fee will be sent to the Mint Fee Manager, which ensures the sustainability and growth of the Xenify ecosystem by utilising them to create liquidity.

To kickstart this process, the Mint Fee Manager receives an allocation of 100,000 preminted XNF tokens when XNF is deployed. These tokens serve the purpose of creating XNF liquidity through the mint fee. The 100,000 XNF tokens are split evenly, with 50,000 tokens allocated for the vXEN Mint Fee and 50,000 tokens for the vUSDy Mint Fee. The team does not have access to these preminted tokens, and can only execute the burning of these tokens if necessary.

Here’s how it works: When a user executes the burn function and sends a mint fee, the Mint Fee Manager will pair 50% of the native tokens acquired from the mint fee with the preminted XNF tokens, to add as XNF liquidity at full range, with all LP tokens being sent to the dead address. The remaining 50% will be utilised to either create XEN liquidity or USDy liquidity, depending on whether the user has sent a mint fee to acquire vXEN or vUSDy, respectively. This process will continue until the preminted XNF allocation is depleted. After that, the manager initiates its default process, which involves using 25% of the native tokens to purchase XNF, and pair the acquired XNF with 25% of the native tokens, to add as liquidity at full range, with all LP tokens being sent to the dead address.

![Grey V4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60996729/235287926-6b18081e-ca41-48c7-8dfc-29cc32c598f1.png)

## ◽️ vXEN Mint Fee

The vXEN mint fee is applicable only when you burn a XEN token variant to obtain vXEN. The mint fee is determined by the current market value of the tokens you burn. The native tokens generated from the vXEN mint fee will be allocated as follows:

- **50% will be used to create XNF liquidity:** The protocol uses 50% of the native tokens to create XNF liquidity for the chain. If the 50,000 Preminted XNF is available, the full amount of the native tokens will be paired with preminted XNF for liquidity pairing, with the LP tokens being sent to a dead address. However, if the preminted XNF allocation has been depleted, the protocol will use half of the 50% native tokens to purchase XNF tokens and the remaining 25% of the native tokens for liquidity pairing, with the LP tokens being sent to a dead address.

- **50% will be used to create XEN token liquidity:** The protocol utilises 50% of the native chain tokens to create liquidity for the native XEN token variant for the most liquid XEN pool on that chain (for example, on the BNB Chain it will create liquidity for bXEN-BNB liquidity), by using 25% of the tokens to purchase the native XEN token (e.g. bXEN) and the remaining 25% of the tokens for the liquidity pairing with the LP tokens being sent to a dead address.

- For example, let's say you have 10,000 bXEN and you want to convert it to vXEN. If bXEN is currently valued at $0.01 and you hold 10,000 bXEN, your bXEN is worth $100. Therefore, you would need to provide $100 in BNB for the mint fee. Additionally, you would need to pay a burn fee, which let's assume is $20 in BNB as determined by the protocol. Once you initiate the mint process, you will receive $200 worth of vXEN in return, based on your $100 worth of bXEN and $100 worth of BNB. Your vXEN will then be burned to participate in Xenify's daily distribution of XNF tokens. The $100 worth of bXEN and $200 worth of vXEN you sent during the burn process will be permanently removed from circulation. The $100 BNB contribution for the mint fee will go to the vXEN Mint Fee Manager, and the $20 BNB burn fee will be distributed among veXNF holders as native chain rewards at the end of the cycle.

![Grey V4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60996729/235287926-6b18081e-ca41-48c7-8dfc-29cc32c598f1.png)

## ◽️ vUSDy Mint Fee

The vUSDy mint fee is only applicable when you convert USDy, xYSL or bYSL to vUSDy through the burn process. The native tokens generated from the vUSDy mint fee will be allocated as follows:

- **50% will be used to create XNF liquidity:** The protocol uses 50% of the native tokens to create XNF liquidity for the chain. If the 50,000 Preminted XNF is available, the full amount of the native tokens will be paired with preminted XNF for liquidity pairing, with the LP tokens being sent to a dead address. However, if the preminted XNF allocation has been depleted, the protocol will use half of the 50% native tokens to purchase XNF tokens and the remaining 25% of the native tokens for liquidity pairing, with the LP tokens being sent to a dead address.

- **50% will be used to create USDy treasury-owned liquidity:** The protocol utilises 50% of the native tokens to create USDy-USDC treasury-owned liquidity, by minting the USDy side of the liquidity pairing and purchasing USDC with the 50% of the tokens, with the LP tokens being sent to the YSL.IO Treasury.

- For example, let's say you have 100 USDy tokens and you want to convert them into vUSDy. To cover the mint fee and burn fee, you need to hold native chain tokens. The mint fee will be determined as $100 BNB, based on the fixed conversion rate of $1.00 per USDy. If you decide to proceed, you'll need to provide a burn fee of $20 BNB to execute the burn function. After you initiate the burn process, the protocol will generate vUSDy based on the total value of your USDy and the mint fee. In this example, you'll receive $200 vUSDy in return, considering your 100 USDy and the $100 BNB mint fee. Your vUSDy will then be burned to participate in Xenify's daily distribution of XNF tokens, and there won't be any burn fee for this step. Both the 100 USDy and 200 vUSDy you sent during the burn process will be permanently removed from circulation. The $100 BNB mint fee will be sent to the vUSDy Mint Fee Manager, and the $20 BNB burn fee will be distributed among XNF stakers at the end of the cycle as native chain rewards.

![Grey V4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60996729/235287926-6b18081e-ca41-48c7-8dfc-29cc32c598f1.png)

## ◽️ XNF Cycle Distribution

Xenify adopts a balanced approach to the daily distribution of XNF, focusing on three components for the Genesis Chain: burn fees, swap fees, and the YSL.IO protocol. Each element is granted an allocation from the daily mint, with 50% distributed to those that participate in burns of vXEN or vUSDy, 25% distributed among those that perform swaps, and the remaining allocation of XNF will be set aside as claimable XNF for the YSL.IO AlphaVaults (15%) and AceVaults (10%). For instance, if the daily XNF mint is 20,000 XNF tokens, Xenify will divide the allocation four ways, distributing 10,000 XNF among burn fee contributors, 5,000 XNF among swap fee contributors, and set aside 3,000 XNF for YSL.IO AlphaVaults, and 2,000 XNF for YSL.IO AceVaults. For all other chains, the daily distribution of XNF will be split 50:50, with 50% distributed to those that participate in burns of vXEN or vUSDy, and 50% distributed among those that perform swaps.

To ascertain each user's share of the daily mint allocated to burn and swap contributions, the protocol will perform a series of calculations. These calculations will be based on the swap and burn contributions made by a user during the cycle. The protocol will consolidate these contributions to accurately compute the total XNF distribution for each user. This methodical approach ensures an equitable distribution, crediting both the user's active engagement in token burns and their contribution in terms of swap fees.

The protocol calculates the burn contribution (BC) of a specific user in a cycle, based on the total XNF tokens distributed (TCD), the total number of batches burned by all users (TNB), and the number of batches burned by the specific user (UNB). Here's the formula explained in detail:

<br>

$$
BC = (TCD \div 2) \times (UBB \div TBB)
$$

<br>

**Where:**

- *BC* - represents the burn contribution of the user.
- *TCD* - is the total amount of XNF tokens distributed in a cycle.
- *UBB* - is the number of batches a specific user has burned in a cycle.
- *TBB* - is the total number of batches burned in a cycle by all users.

<br>

Here’s how it works: The protocol calculates the burn contribution by first dividing the total tokens distributed during a cycle (TCD) by 2, as 50% of the XNF daily mint is allocated to participants that burn vXEN or vUSDy. It then calculates the proportion of batches burned by the specific user (UNB) to the total batches burned by all users (TNB). This results in a value per batch burned. Finally, the protocol multiplies these two values to determine the user's individual burn contribution within that cycle (BC).

The calculation of the swap contribution follows a similar logic, whereby the protocol calculates the swap contribution (SC) of a specific user in a cycle, based on the total XNF tokens distributed (TCD), the total swap fees paid by all users (TSF), and the swap fees paid by the specific user (USF). Here's the formula explained in detail:

<br>

$$
SC = (TCD \times SP) \times (USF \div TSF)
$$

<br>

**Where:**

- *SC* - represents the swap contribution of the user.
- *SP* - is the percentage of the XNF daily mint allocated to swaps.
- *TCD* - is the total amount of XNF tokens distributed in a cycle.
- *USF* - is the swap fees paid by a specific user in a cycle.
- *TSF* - is the total swap fees paid in a cycle by all users.

<br>

Here’s how it works: The protocol calculates the user's swap contribution (SC) by first multiplying the total XNF tokens distributed (TCD) by the percentage of XNF daily mint allocated to participants that perform swaps on supported chains (this will be 25% for the Genesis Chain and 50% for all other chains). It then multiplies the result by the ratio of the user's swap fees (USF) to the total swap fees (TSF) paid by all users. This generates a specific value for each unit of swap fee paid and helps in determining the proportion of XNF tokens a user receives based on their individual contribution to the swap fees in a given cycle.

## ◽️ Staking XNF Tokens

Every cycle, Xenify's protocol distributes newly minted XNF tokens to users. The distribution occurs at the end of each day, and it follows a specific allocation structure. Users who perform direct burns of vXEN and vUSDy receive 50% of the daily minted XNF, while those who engage in swaps on supported EVM chains receive 25% of the daily minted XNF on the Genesis Chain and 50% on all other chains. Additionally, a portion of the daily minted XNF on the Genesis Chain is designated as claimable XNF for the YSL.IO protocol, whereby AceVaults receive 10% of the daily XNF mint, while the AlphaVaults are allocated 15%.

Only staked XNF tokens contribute to a user's accumulation of native chain rewards, with each user's share determined by their veXNF position and its associated earning power. Staked tokens begin to accumulate native chain rewards within the same cycle they are staked. These native chain rewards are collected into a reward pool during each cycle, and subsequently distributed by the protocol among XNF stakers at the end of the daily cycle.

To earn a share native chain rewards on Xenify, users need to either manually stake XNF or actively claim their daily XNF allocation. By doing so, they inherently lock their XNF for a chosen staking cycle, which can range from a minimum of 2 weeks to a maximum of 4 years. Once the desired lock period is set, the user's XNF is staked and locked accordingly. As a result, the protocol mints veXNF tokens for the user, based on the amount of XNF staked and the selected lock period. Throughout this lock period, users will not be able to unstake their XNF, but they continue to accumulate native chain rewards. The earning power of their veXNF determines the distribution of these rewards.

It is important to note that claiming XNF on Xenify does not incur a claim fee. However, if XNF is claimed through the YSL.IO AlphaVaults and AceVaults, a claim fee is applicable based on the underlying value of the claimed XNF and the time-weighted claim coefficient. All XNF claim fees generated on YSL.IO during a cycle are set aside and distributed among veXNF holders at the end of each cycle.

Furthermore, any unclaimed XNF on the YSL.IO protocol at the end of a cycle will be redistributed to recyclers as claimable XNF. This exclusive redistribution does not apply to unclaimed XNF held by users on Xenify. Only veXNF holders who recycled their rewards in the last cycle are eligible for this exclusive redistribution. The share of XNF received by each recycler depends on their veXNF holdings. When a recycler decides to claim these XNF tokens, they must select their preferred lock period (ranging from 2 weeks to 4 years). Consequently, their XNF is staked and locked for the chosen duration, and Xenify mints veXNF tokens based on the staked XNF and the selected lock period.

![Grey V4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60996729/235287926-6b18081e-ca41-48c7-8dfc-29cc32c598f1.png)

## ◽️ Unstaking XNF Tokens

After completing their chosen staking cycle, users have the option to unstake their XNF tokens. It's important to note that users are unable to unstake their XNF during their specified lock period. However, users will accumulate native chain rewards throughout the lock period. These rewards are directly connected to their veXNF position, with the power of a user's veXNF during the staking cycle determining their share of each reward distribution. 

Once the chosen lock period is over, the earning power of a user's veXNF position will completely decay. This means that they will no longer earn native chain rewards on their position. At this point, users have two choices: they can either extend their stake cycle for a maximum duration of 4 years to preserve the earning power of their veXNF, or they can decide to unstake their XNF tokens and regain full ownership.

The decision of whether to extend the stake cycle or unstake the tokens is entirely up to the user. Xenify provides flexibility for each user to assess their preferences and make an informed decision about the best course of action for their circumstances.

![Grey V4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60996729/235287926-6b18081e-ca41-48c7-8dfc-29cc32c598f1.png)

## ◽️ Claiming Native Chain Rewards

Xenify empowers users to effortlessly claim and withdraw their accumulated native chain rewards at their convenience. However, be aware that a 25% Claim Fee will be applied when claiming your native chain rewards. 

To sidestep the 25% Claim Fee, simply click the "Recycle" button. This enables you to use your accumulated native chain tokens to acquire XNF by participating in the daily burn of vUSDy, avoiding the Claim Fee entirely. Throughout each cycle, the native tokens collected from this fee are stored in a temporary pool. At the end of the cycle, these tokens are exclusively distributed among veXNF holders who have employed the Recycle function during the cycle.

This unique distribution occurs during the protocol's daily distribution of native chain rewards, with each eligible participant receiving a share based on their position. For instance, if a user recycles their rewards during a cycle, they will be included in the distribution of proceeds generated from the Claim Fee at the end of that cycle.

![Grey V4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60996729/235287926-6b18081e-ca41-48c7-8dfc-29cc32c598f1.png)

## ◽️ Recycling Native Chain Rewards

Discover the smart way to maximise your rewards with Xenify's recycling feature! By choosing to recycle your native chain rewards, you'll not only bypass the 25% claim fee but also boost your XNF position, as your entire rewards balance is used to join the daily vXEN burn.

What sets this process apart is the protocol's capability to mint vXEN tokens equivalent to the value of your rewards and directly deduct the burn fee from your reward balance. This means you can burn vXEN without the need for additional native chain rewards to cover the obligatory mint fee or burn fee, which is typically required in the default burn process.

By making use of the recycle function, you'll also gain exclusive access to the daily distribution of native tokens generated from the platform's 25% claim fee. This claim fee will be collected every time a user decides to claim their native chain rewards. At the end of the cycle, the accumulated native tokens will be distributed exclusively to veXNF holders that have recycled during the cycle. The more native chain rewards you recycle within a cycle, the greater your share for that cycle. For example, if $100,000 worth of native chain rewards were claimed during a cycle and you are the sole XNF staker recycling during that cycle, you would receive the entire $25,000 worth of native chain tokens generated from the claim fee at the end of the cycle.

But that’s not all! As a gesture of gratitude for their active involvement with the protocol, veXNF holders who recycle their rewards during a cycle are also eligible for an exclusive distribution of unclaimed XNF from the YSL.IO protocol. Once a cycle concludes, any unclaimed XNF from the YLS.IO AlphaVaults and AceVaults are redistributed to veXNF holders based on the amount of rewards they have recycled during the cycle. Put simply, the more native chain rewards you recycle during a cycle, the greater your share of any unclaimed XNF.

To leverage this recycling feature, ensure that you have a sufficient balance of native chain rewards to acquire at least one batch of vXEN for the burn process. If your reward balance falls short of the required amount of native chain tokens, the recycle option will not be accessible to you. By recycling your native chain rewards, you'll not only strengthen your XNF position but also enjoy a streamlined process that eliminates the usual burn function fees. Most importantly, as a dedicated recycler, you will benefit from the 25% claim fee and qualify for an exclusive redistribution of unclaimed XNF from the YSL.IO AlphaVaults and AceVaults. It's a win-win situation that rewards your active participation and commitment to the growth of Xenify.

![Grey V4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60996729/235287926-6b18081e-ca41-48c7-8dfc-29cc32c598f1.png)

## ♦️ Recycle Process Overview

  - You decide to recycle your native chain rewards.
  - The protocol employs Chainlink's price oracle to ascertain the dollar value of your native chain reward balance.
  - Based on the dollar value of your contribution, the protocol mints an appropriate number of vXEN batches. The number of batches is determined by rounding down to the nearest batch count.
  - All the minted vXEN batches are burned to obtain XNF tokens, and the protocol collects a burn fee from your native chain rewards balance.
  - After the burn process, your remaining native chain rewards are sent to the Recycling Contract.
  - The Recycling Contract splits the native tokens three ways: 50% for creating XNF liquidity, 25% for creating XEN liquidity, and 25% allocated to the team as USDC to support Xenify's ongoing development, marketing, and outreach initiatives.
  - The XNF LP tokens and XEN LP tokens acquired from the recycling process are sent to a dead address.
  - At the end of the daily burn auction, you receive XNF tokens based on the vXEN batches burned from your recycled contribution.
  - Next, you will receive your share of daily native chain rewards based on your veXNF balance and its associated power.
  - Finally, as a recycler, you will also receive a portion of any native chain tokens collected from the claim fee during the cycle, as well as a share of any unclaimed XNF redistributed from the YSL.IO AlphaVault and AceVault allocation.

![Grey V4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60996729/235287926-6b18081e-ca41-48c7-8dfc-29cc32c598f1.png)

## ◽️ Native Token Reward Distribution

During each cycle, the protocol's reward pool gradually accumulates native tokens generated from burn fees and swap fees. This pool grows with every transaction, whether it's a swap or a burn. 

At the end of the cycle, the yield obtained from the rehypothecation of YSL.IO AlphaVault assets is added to the reward pool. The total sum of the reward pool is then distributed among XNF stakers based on their veXNF holdings and associated power.

In addition to the distribution of native tokens from swap fees, burn fees, and rehypothecation of AlphaVault assets, there are exclusive distributions of native tokens for veXNF holders who have recycled their rewards during the cycle. These additional distributions include native tokens generated from Xenify's 25% claim fee for native chain rewards and the XNF claim fee applicable to YSL.IO AlphaVault and AceVault participants.

It's important to note that claiming XNF on Xenify doesn't incur a claim fee. However, if veXNF holders choose to claim their native chain rewards, there will be a 25% claim fee. The native chain tokens acquired from this claim fee during a cycle are set aside and distributed among veXNF holders who have recycled in the previous cycle. Similarly, when XNF is claimed through the YSL.IO AlphaVaults and AceVaults, a claim fee is applicable based on the value of the claimed XNF and the time-weighted claim coefficient. All XNF claim fees generated on YSL.IO during a cycle are set aside and distributed among veXNF holders at the end of each cycle.

With this unique reward structure, Xenify is able to strengthen the demand and value for XNF, while providing a compelling incentive for holders to actively participate in the protocol. This encourages engagement and cultivates a growing user base, helping to fortify the protocol's long-term growth.

# ◽️ XNF Airdrops
![Line Divider - Filled](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60996729/233879462-b465c484-4c2f-4cd2-a126-19529e333d64.png)

<br>

Introducing Xenify's exclusive XNF Airdrop event, a unique incentive to boost liquidity creation and encourage user engagement across supported EVM chains. Before XNF is deployed onto a new chain, there will be a 60-day airdrop event preceding the launch. This exclusive event will reward swap participants with a generous allocation of 1,500,000 XNF tokens.

The 1,500,000 XNF tokens distributed as locked tokens on the first day of launch will gradually unlock over a period of 730 days. Let's say you receive 100 locked XNF tokens from the airdrop; you can expect approximately 0.13699 XNF tokens to be unlocked in your wallet each day (100 XNF tokens / 730 days = 0.13699 XNF tokens per day). Just keep in mind that locked XNF tokens cannot be staked, so if you plan on earning native chain rewards you should consider participating in the daily burn auction to acquire XNF that can be staked.

In order to ensure fairness and prevent last-minute sniping, a fixed daily amount of the airdrop will be allocated throughout the event. This guarantees that participants receive a proportionate share of the airdrop based on their engagement. For example, during the Genesis Airdrop on the BNB Chain, which spans 60 days, each day will have 25,000 XNF tokens allocated. So, if you're the only participant on the first day, you'll receive 25,000 locked XNF tokens. It's important to note that the daily allocation may vary for future chains based on the event duration. To maintain constant engagement, a user's contributions during one event will not be considered for subsequent airdrops. This ensures that users who contribute only once are not consistently included in future airdrops.

Moreover, during the active Airdrop event for a specific chain, the native tokens generated from the 0.5% swap fee on that chain will be collected and distributed as part of the initial reward distribution for veXNF holders. For example, before the Genesis launch on the BNB Chain, a 60-day airdrop event will take place, with 100% of the BNB generated from swaps on the BNB Chain during the event reserved for the initial reward distribution.

This positive feedback loop not only incentivises users to participate in the first burn cycle to acquire a share of BNB, but it also kickstarts the liquidity pool by utilising mint fees from burns to generate XNF liquidity. As more users swap, the accumulated swap fees increase the rewards for day 1 burners, which in turn leads to more users burning on day 1 to secure a share. This results in a higher amount of generated mint fees, ultimately leading to greater XNF liquidity!

# ◽️ Amplify Burns
![Line Divider - Filled](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60996729/233879462-b465c484-4c2f-4cd2-a126-19529e333d64.png)

<br>

Introducing [Phoenix Apes](https://docs.ysl.io/protocol-features/Phoenix-NFT), the exclusive NFT collectable that unites the Xenify and YSL.IO communities. By owning one of these extraordinary NFTs, users of Xenify will unlock a daily amplified burn effect, exponentially boosting their batch count by up to 100 when burning vXEN or vUSDy. Moreover, owning or renting a minimum of 4 of these highly coveted NFTs will grant you an even greater amplification, with your wallet receiving a daily bonus of up to 1,000 batches.

Furthermore, holders of the Phoenix NFT will enjoy a range of extra perks. This includes the opportunity to earn USDC rewards every 8 hours and bypass the Sigma Exit Rate on the YSL.IO protocol. These additional benefits enhance user engagement while making significant contributions to the growth of both the Xenify and YSL.IO ecosystems.

Every wallet that holds a Phoenix Ape NFT is subject to a Weekly Outbound Quota (WOQ) that permits a single outbound transaction involving a Phoenix Ape NFT every 7 days. Outbound transactions include transferring a Phoenix Ape NFT to another wallet or selling the NFT. Please note that while the WOQ restriction is in effect, wallet holders are still permitted to bridge the utility of their Phoenix Ape NFT(s) to another chain. In short, bridging the utility of an NFT to a different chain neither triggers the WOQ nor impacts the user's ability to bridge their Phoenix Ape NFT(s) utility.

And here's the best part: Your daily batch bonus, whether you possess one NFT or four NFTs, can seamlessly be bridged to any chain that Xenify launches. With your burn bonus resetting each day, you'll have the opportunity to reap the benefits of this amplified burn effect across all chains Xenify launches on a daily basis!

![Grey V4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60996729/235287926-6b18081e-ca41-48c7-8dfc-29cc32c598f1.png)

## ◽️ Limited Collectible

The Phoenix Apes, an exclusive NFT collection developed for YSL.IO, boasts a scarce supply of just 520. These sought-after NFTs have been ingeniously designed with utility at their core. Not only do they possess distinctive rarities, but they also grant the holder exceptional benefits within the YSL.IO ecosystem.

![Grey V4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60996729/235287926-6b18081e-ca41-48c7-8dfc-29cc32c598f1.png)

## ◽️ Daily Amplified Burn Effect

Phoenix Ape NFT holders unlock an exclusive amplified burn effect when they choose to burn vXEN or vUSDy on Xenify. This unique advantage empowers NFT holders to secure a larger share of the daily distribution of XNF, while also benefiting from significant discounts on their burn fees. By bridging both communities, this exceptional benefit fosters unity and fuels growth for both protocols.

Here's how it works: When Phoenix Ape NFT holders decide to burn vXEN or vUSDy on Xenify, they unlock a daily burn bonus that doubles their batch count (NB). The bonus is capped at 100 daily batches per NFT ID. Once a user uses up all 100 daily bonus batches allocated to their Phoenix Ape NFT, that specific NFT will no longer offer an amplified burn for that day.

Looking for extra firepower? We've got fantastic news! By owning or renting at least 4 of these highly sought-after NFTs, you'll benefit from even greater amplification, with your wallet receiving a daily bonus of 1,000 batches. This effectively replaces the default 100 daily bonus batches reserved for each of your four NFT IDs. In short, if you hold 4 NFTs, your total daily bonus will be capped at 1,000 batches, not 1,400 batches.

Remember, the more batches you burn, the more you save on burn fees. By holding 4 NFTs, you can achieve maximum savings of 75% off your burn fees by burning just 9,000 batches during the first hour of a cycle instead of the usual 10,000. Plus, with Phoenix Ape NFTs having a limited supply of 520, there can only be a maximum of 130 wallet addresses that can seize this extra firepower.

And here's the best part: Your daily batch bonus, whether you have one NFT or four NFTs, can be seamlessly bridged to any chain that Xenify launches. Let's say Xenify expands to Polygon and you hold 4 Phoenix Ape NFTs. Once you've exhausted your daily 1,000 batch bonus on the BNB Chain, you can easily bridge the utility of your NFTs to Polygon and enjoy 1,000 bonus batches there. With your multiplier resetting every day, you'll have the opportunity to reap the benefits of this amplified burn effect across all chains Xenify launches on a daily basis!

In summary, holders of Phoenix Ape NFTs not only enjoy an increased share of the daily XNF distribution but also unlock greater discounts on the burn fee by burning a larger amount of batches. The maximum amount of batches per transaction is capped at 10,000 batches, and the burn fee discount is represented by the term (1 - (NB x CS)) in the protocols burn fee formula:

<br>

$$
BF = (FC \times VB) \times (1 - (NB \times BC))
$$

**Where:**

- $BF$ (Burn Fee) - The fee charged for the burn function, paid in the native token of the blockchain.
- $FC$ (Burn Fee Coefficient) - A time-weighted coefficient used to factor in a discount on the burn fee.
- $VB$ (Value of Batches) - The dollar value of batches being burned by the user, influencing the burn fee as the value of batches increases.
- $BC$ (Batch Coefficient) - A time-weighted coefficient used to factor in the discount based on the batches being burned.
- $NB$ (Number of Batches) - The number of batches the user burns, influencing the discount in burn fees as the number of batches increases. This will be capped at 10,000 batches.

## ◽️ Example: Amplified Burn Effect

Let's take a closer look at how the amplified burn works in different scenarios:

![Grey V4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60996729/235287926-6b18081e-ca41-48c7-8dfc-29cc32c598f1.png)

## ♦️ Scenario 1: If you hold between 1 and 3 Phoenix Ape NFTs

  - Each Phoenix Ape NFT is equipped with a daily bonus multiplier limited to 100 batches. When burning a specific number of batches, the protocol first verifies if any of your NFTs possess a bonus balance. If so, the protocol uses your bonus balance to increase your batch count. 

  - For instance, imagine you have a daily bonus of 100 batches on your NFT and opt to burn 10 batches. The protocol will effectively double your batch count to 20 batches, by utilising 10 of your daily bonus batches. Consequently, 10 batches from your NFT ID's daily bonus will be deducted, leaving 90 bonus batches for that NFT on that day.

  - However, if you decide to burn an amount exceeding your bonus balance, the protocol will consume the entire balance of your NFT. For example, if your current daily bonus balance is 90 batches and you choose to burn 5,000 batches, the burn process will count it as 5,090 batches, using up the entire 90 batches from your NFT's bonus balance. As a result, 90 bonus batches allocated to the NFT ID will be removed, leaving zero bonus batches for that NFT on that day. Fear not, your bonus batch count will reset to 100 the following day.

  - Additionally, you have the option to bridge your NFT's utility to another chain where Xenify has launched. By doing so, you can access an extra 100 daily bonus batches on that day, effectively granting you 200 daily bonus batches for your NFT. For example, if you've exhausted your daily bonus on the BNB Chain, simply bridge your NFT's utility to Polygon and receive 1,000 daily bonus batches on Polygon. This process can be repeated for each chain where Xenify has been deployed.

![Grey V4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60996729/235287926-6b18081e-ca41-48c7-8dfc-29cc32c598f1.png)

## ♦️ Scenario 2: If you hold 4 or more Phoenix Ape NFTs

  - If you own or rent 4 Phoenix Ape NFTs, burning batches becomes even more rewarding. Your wallet will receive a daily bonus of 1,000 batches. This effectively replaces the default 100 daily bonus batches reserved for each of your NFT IDs. In short, if you hold 4 or more NFTs in your wallet, your total daily bonus will be capped at 1,000 batches for that wallet. When you choose to burn a batch amount that is less than your current daily bonus, the protocol will double your batch count by using an equivalent amount. 

  - For instance, if you have 4 NFTs and a daily bonus of 1,000 batches, burning 1 batch will be counted as 2 batches during the burn process. This means that 1 batch will be deducted from your daily NFTs bonus, leaving you with 999 bonus batches for the day on that chain.

  - On the other hand, if you decide to burn a batch amount greater than your current daily bonus, the protocol will utilise your entire bonus balance. Let's say you have 4 NFTs and a daily bonus of 1,000 batches. If you choose to burn the equivalent of 6,000 batches, it will be counted as 7,000 batches during the burn process. The protocol will use your entire daily batch bonus of 1,000 for this. As a result, you won't have any bonus batches remaining to use for that particular day on that chain. But don't worry, once the next day begins, your bonus batch count will reset back to 1,000.

  - Additionally, you can choose to bridge the utility of your 4 NFTs to another chain that Xenify has launched. By doing this, you can use an additional 1,000 daily bonus batches on that day, effectively giving you 2,000 daily bonus batches. For example, if you've used up your daily bonus on the BNB Chain, you can simply bridge your NFTs' utility to Polygon and receive 1,000 daily bonus batches on Polygon. You can repeat this process for each chain where Xenify has been deployed.

## ◽️ Claimable USDC Rewards

The Phoenix NFT has been designed to be a game-changer in the world of NFTs. With its innovative rental mechanism, this unique NFT actively supports the YSL.IO ecosystem and allows users to generate rental income, whilst renters enjoy the advantage of bypassing the protocol’s Sigma Exit Rate. When a Phoenix Ape NFT is rented through the YSL.IO marketplace, a portion of the user's rental income is collected as tax. Combined with a share of royalty taxes from OpenSea, these earnings are then distributed among all Phoenix Ape NFT holders as USDC rewards on the BNB Chain.

These USDC rewards will be available for holders to claim at the end of each 8-hour epoch. And here's the cherry on top: even if a user decides to bridge their Phoenix NFT from the BNB chain to amplify burns with Xenify on another chain, they'll still be eligible for the USDC distribution. In simpler terms, the claimable USDC rewards on the BNB Chain will be reserved for all addresses that hold the Phoenix Ape NFT, regardless of whether they bridge utility to another chain.

![Grey V4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60996729/235287926-6b18081e-ca41-48c7-8dfc-29cc32c598f1.png)

## ◽️ Bypassing the Sigma Exit Rate
    
The YSL.IO protocol has been purpose-built to provide stability and resilience for all participants. The protocol showcases an innovative Price Stability Model (PSM) that not only aims to stabilise the price of native tokens (YSL, xYSL, bYSL, and USDy), but also guarantees users experience high exit liquidity and preserves the long-term growth of treasury-owned liquidity.

A crucial component of the PSM is the Sigma Exit Rate, which restricts token sales from a wallet by considering the user's acquisition or last sale of the token. However, privileged Phoenix Ape NFT holders can enjoy the freedom to sell up to 100% of their xYSL, bYSL, or USDy tokens without being subjected to the Sigma Exit Rate. This exclusive feature grants users ultimate flexibility and control over their YSL.IO native token holdings.

## ◽️ Users Mint Their Equity

- XNF tokens will not be pre-mined or allocated to investors or team members. Instead, users can acquire XNF tokens by actively engaging with the protocol, whether by burning vXEN or vUSDy tokens, or swapping tokens from a supported chain. This approach rewards users for their contributions and guarantees a fair distribution of XNF within the ecosystem.

![Grey V4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60996729/235287926-6b18081e-ca41-48c7-8dfc-29cc32c598f1.png)

## ◽️ Immutable Contracts (No Admin Keys)

  - Xenify's smart contracts will be carefully crafted without admin keys or centralised control, safeguarding the protocol's immutability and preserving its decentralised nature. What does this mean? Once our tokenomics and protocol architecture are deployed, they're set in stone – no upgrades or alterations can be made. This commitment to immutability delivers a stable, transparent, and secure environment for our community, ensuring that no single entity can make arbitrary decisions to manipulate the protocol.

We understand that you may have questions about Xenify, its features, and its potential. To help you navigate our platform, we've compiled a list of frequently asked questions that provide clarity and insights into Xenify and its ecosystem.

![Grey V4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60996729/235287926-6b18081e-ca41-48c7-8dfc-29cc32c598f1.png)

## ◽️ Does XNF have an initial supply?
  - No, Xenify does not have an initial supply, and there is no pre-mine of XNF tokens. Instead, the protocol rewards users on a daily basis for their active participation in the ecosystem. This is achieved through various contributions, such as burn fee contributions made by directly burning vXEN or vUSDy tokens, as well as swap fees generated through the Xenify aggregator. Notably, all burn fees and swap fees collected on supported EVM chains are directed towards XNF stakers on a daily basis, providing significant long-term earning potential.

  - Furthermore, Xenify ensures a fair distribution of XNF tokens by setting aside a daily allocation of claimable XNF for participants in YSL.IO AlphaVaults and AceVaults. These participants can claim their share, and the claim fees are subsequently rewarded back to XNF stakers. This approach not only encourages active engagement within the protocol but also promotes fairness and inclusivity.

  - By implementing this equitable distribution system, Xenify aims to create a level playing field for all users, preventing any concentration of tokens in the hands of a few early adopters. Instead, the protocol emphasizes the importance of ongoing user involvement and contributions, as they directly translate into tangible rewards. This innovative approach distinguishes Xenify as a platform that values its community and actively encourages their participation in shaping the ecosystem.

## ◽️ What does the recycle button do?
  - The recycle button is a user-friendly feature that prioritises the needs of veXNF holders. By simply clicking this button, users can conveniently convert their accumulated native chain rewards into XNF through the daily burn auction. This feature brings several advantages. Firstly, it allows you to participate in the burn cycle without incurring the mandatory mint fee and burn fee associated with the default burn process. This means you can enjoy the benefits of acquiring XNF through the burn cycle while saving on additional fees. 

  - Moreover, by choosing to recycle your rewards, you actively contribute to the growth and sustainability of the Xenify ecosystem. The protocol utilises 50% of your accrued native chain rewards to create XNF liquidity, enabling a more robust and efficient market for the token. Additionally, 25% of the rewards are used to create XEN liquidity, further enhancing the ecosystem's overall liquidity. Lastly, the remaining 25% is sent as USDC to the team, supporting ongoing operational expenses such as platform development, marketing campaigns, and community engagement activities. 

  - By recycling your rewards, you not only enhance your own benefits but also play a vital role in the continued success of the Xenify platform. As a result, recyclers will receive an additional exclusive distribution of native chain tokens generated from the platform's claim fees. This means that by actively participating in the recycling process, you have the opportunity to secure even more native chain tokens, boosting your overall holdings. Moreover, recyclers will also have the chance to obtain additional XNF tokens through the redistribution of unclaimed XNF from the YSL.IO AlphaVaults and AceVaults. This adds another layer of potential rewards and benefits for those who choose to recycle.

  - In conclusion, the recycle button feature not only offers convenience but also presents numerous advantages for veXNF holders. By saving on fees, contributing to ecosystem growth, and accessing exclusive distributions, recyclers can maximise their benefits while supporting the ongoing success of the Xenify platform.

## ◽️ Why will XNF appreciate in value?
  - The value of XNF holds the potential to appreciate significantly due to Xenify’s innovative tokenomics, thriving ecosystem, and the increasing demand for native chain rewards. With Xenify's cutting-edge cross-chain aggregator, users can enjoy seamless token swapping and engage in various rewarding activities, which drives protocol adoption and ultimately the value of XNF.

  - Additionally, the scarcity of XNF tokens, brought about by halving events, is likely to boost the token's value as more users choose Xenify as their preferred platform for swapping tokens. This will lead to more native chain rewards for XNF stakers, resulting in a growing demand for XNF tokens. Consequently, the token value is poised to rise due to demand, cementing Xenify's position as a promising project within the XEN ecosystem.

## ◽️ If I make a stake now when can I unstake?
  - When you choose to stake your XNF, you'll have the opportunity to select a staking cycle that suits your preferences, ranging from a minimum of 2 weeks to a maximum of 4 years. It's important to note that once you begin the staking cycle, your XNF tokens will be locked, and you won't be able to unstake them until the cycle is completed. Once your chosen staking cycle comes to an end, you'll have the freedom to unstake your XNF tokens, reclaiming full ownership and control over them. By participating in staking, you contribute to the overall health of our ecosystem, and in return, you have the opportunity to earn native chain rewards on a daily basis!

![Grey V4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60996729/235287926-6b18081e-ca41-48c7-8dfc-29cc32c598f1.png)

## ◽️ How do I generate rewards with Xenify?
  - Xenify offers users the opportunity to earn rewards like ETH, BNB, and MATIC on a daily basis by staking XNF tokens. These rewards are distributed among XNF stakers based on their veXNF balance and the power associated with their veXNF. This incentive model not only encourages active participation but also plays a vital role in fostering the long-term growth and sustainability of the protocol.

![Grey V4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60996729/235287926-6b18081e-ca41-48c7-8dfc-29cc32c598f1.png)

## ◽️ If I make a stake now when will I receive rewards?
  - When you stake XNF tokens, you will receive rewards at the end of the cycle in which you make the stake. Throughout the cycle, these rewards accumulate in a reward pool, and the protocol distributes the entire reward pool of native chain tokens among veXNF holders at the end of the cycle based on their veXNF balance and associated power, ensuring a fair and transparent distribution.

![Grey V4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60996729/235287926-6b18081e-ca41-48c7-8dfc-29cc32c598f1.png)

## ◽️ Are there different ways to participate with Xenify?
- Yes, there are several ways to participate with Xenify, including:

  - Utilise the Xenify aggregator to perform seamless single-click swaps and earn XNF in the process.
  - Engage in direct burns of vXEN or vUSDy to acquire XNF.
  - Stake XNF tokens to earn native chain tokens such as ETH, BNB and MATIC.
  - Purchase a Phoenix Ape NFT to unlock daily amplified burns and more.
  - Contribute to the protocol's growth through community initiatives.

![Grey V4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60996729/235287926-6b18081e-ca41-48c7-8dfc-29cc32c598f1.png)

## ◽️ What happens if there are no token swaps or burns during a daily cycle?

- In the unlikely event that no swaps occur on Xenify, and no users burn either vXEN or vUSDy, the daily XNF cycle distribution will not be carried out. In this scenario, the XNF tokens scheduled for distribution during that cycle will simply not be minted. As a result, the total supply of XNF will decrease by the amount that was intended to be distributed in that cycle.

- For instance, if the daily allocation for a cycle is set at 20,000 XNF, and if no swaps or burns occur during that cycle, the 20,000 XNF will not be minted or distributed. Instead, the total supply of XNF will be reduced by 20,000 XNF at the conclusion of the cycle.

![Grey V4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60996729/235287926-6b18081e-ca41-48c7-8dfc-29cc32c598f1.png)

## ◽️ Direct Burns 

  - When a token is burned it's usually sent to an inactive address and removed from circulation, effectively reducing the total supply by the amount burned. On Xenify, Direct Burns happen when users purposefully burn tokens (vXEN or vUSDy) to promote the growth of the protocol.  As a reward for their commitment to the protocol, users receive XNF tokens in exchange for their burned vXEN or vUSDy tokens.

![Grey V4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60996729/235287926-6b18081e-ca41-48c7-8dfc-29cc32c598f1.png)

## ◽️ Proof of Burn

  - Proof of Burn is a commitment mechanism where users burn tokens to show their support for the protocol. In exchange, they receive equity.

![Grey V4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60996729/235287926-6b18081e-ca41-48c7-8dfc-29cc32c598f1.png)

## ◽️ Swap Volume 
  
  - Swap volume refers to the total value of token swaps executed on the Xenify platform. It serves as the basis for distributing XNF tokens to users during the daily reward cycle.
